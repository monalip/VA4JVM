# VA4JVM

In this project, we focus on the integration of execution traces from the regular JVM into a “jpf-visual” tool 
and visualize different run-time events.

Initially I have created the simple program which have different methods with different parameters. I have created aspectJ 
point-cut and played with point-cut declaration to understand the method call with different parameters, return type.
