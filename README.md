# VA4JVM
In this project, we focus on the integration of execution traces from the regular JVM into a “jpf-visual” tool 
and visualize different run-time events.

Initially I have created the simple program which have different methods with different parameters. I have created aspectJ 
point-cut and played with point-cut declaration to understand the method call with different parameters, return type.

# Script Information:
runAspectJ.sh : Script to run the AspectJ file

runAspectJweaving.sh : Script to run the AspectJ after weaving Thread class.
