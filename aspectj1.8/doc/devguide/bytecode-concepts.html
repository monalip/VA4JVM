        and weaves them together to produce binary-compatible .class files that 
        run in any Java VM and implement the AspectJ semantics.
        This process supports not only the compiler but also IDE's.
        The compiler, given an aspect in source form, produces a binary
        aspect and runs the weaver.  IDE's can get information about
        crosscutting in the program by subscribing to information 
        produced by weaver as a side-effect of weaving.
    </p><p>Incremental compilation involves recompiling only what is necessary
        to bring the binary form of a program up-to-date with the source form
        in the shortest time possible.
        Incremental weaving supports this by weaving on a per-class basis.
        (Some implementations of AOP (including AspectJ 1.0) make use
        of whole-program analysis that can't be done in incremental mode.)
        Weaving per-class means that if the source for a pure Java class 
        is updated, only that class needs to be produced.  However, if
        some crosscutting specification may have been updated, then all
        code potentially affected by it may need to be woven.  The AspectJ
        tools are getting better at minimizing this effect, but it is to
        some degree unavoidable due to the crosscutting semantics.
    </p><p>
        Memory usage can seem higher with AspectJ tools.
        Some aspects are written to potentially affect many classes, so each
        class must be checked during the process of weaving.  Programmers can
        minimize this by writing the crosscutting specifications as narrowly
        as possible while maintaining correctness.
        (While it may seem like more memory, the proper comparison
        would with with a Java program that had the same crosscutting,
        with changes made to each code segment.  That would likely require
        more memory and more time to recompile than the corresponding 
        AspectJ program.)

        weaver which you'll find referenced in <a href="ajc-ref.html">The ajc Command-line Reference</a>,
        <a href="ajbrowser.html">AspectJ Browser</a>, 
        <a href="antTasks.html">AspectJ Ant Tasks</a>,
        and <a href="ltw.html">Load-Time Weaving</a>.
    </p><p>As in Java, the <tt>classpath</tt> is where the AspectJ
        tools resolve types specified in the program. When running an AspectJ
        program, the classpath should contain the classes and aspects along with
        the AspectJ runtime library, <tt>aspectjrt.jar</tt>.
        </p><p>
        In AspectJ tools, the <tt>aspectpath</tt> is where to find binary
        aspects.  Like the classpath, it can include archives (.jar and .zip files) 
        and directories containing .class files in a package layout (since 
        binary aspects are in .class files).  These aspects affect other
        classes in exactly the same way as source-level aspects, but are themselves
        not affected.  When deploying programs, the original aspects must be included 
        on the runtime classpath.
    </p><p>
        In AspectJ tools, the <tt>inpath</tt> is where to find binary
        input - aspects and classes that weave and may be woven.  
        Like the classpath, it can include archives and class directories. 
        Like the aspectpath, it can include aspects that affect other classes
        and aspects.
        However, unlike the aspectpath, an aspect on the inpath may itself be
        affected by aspects, as if the source were all compiled together.
        When deploying aspects that were put on the inpath, only the woven output 
        should be on the runtime classpath.
    </p><p>
        Although types in the inpath and the aspectpath need to be resolved by
        the AspectJ tools, you usually do not need to place them on the classpath
        because this is done automatically by the compiler/weaver.  But when using 
        the <tt>WeavingURLClassLoader</tt>, your code must explicitly add the aspects
        to the classpath so they can be resolved (as you'll see in the sample
        code and the <tt>aj.bat</tt> script).
    </p><p>The most common mistake is failing to add
        <tt>aspectjrt.jar</tt> to the classpath. Also, when
        weaving with binary aspects, users forget to deploy the aspect itself
        along with any classes it requires. A more subtle mistake is putting a
        binary aspect (BA) on the inpath instead of the aspectpath.  In this case
        the aspect BA might be affected by an aspect, even itself; this can 
        cause the program to fail, e.g., when an aspect uses exclusion to 
        avoid infinite recursion but fails to exclude advice in aspect BA.
        </p><p>The latter is one of many ways that mistakes in the build process
            can affect aspects that are written poorly.  Aspects should never
            rely on the boundaries of the build specification to narrow the
            scope of their crosscutting, since the build can be changed 
            without notice to the aspect developer.  Careful users might even
            avoid relying on the implementation scope, to ensure their
            AspectJ code will run on other implementations.
