<h1>AspectJ 5 v1.5.1 Readme</h1>

<p>
This release is primarily a bug fix and performance / memory usage release. 
Over 70 fixes and enhancements have been incorporated since 1.5.0, you can see 
the list through 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&product=AspectJ&target_milestone=1.5.1&bug_status=RESOLVED&bug_status=VERIFIED&bug_status=CLOSED">

</p>
<p>
AspectJ 1.5.1 has significantly lower memory usage than AspectJ 1.5.0, 
especially when building inside of AJDT. The improvements are also noticeable 
when batch building with Ant, or when load-time weaving. Batch building a 
project with over 1000 source files with both AspectJ 1.5.1 and AspectJ 1.5.0 
shows a 16% reduction in peak memory usage, and an 8% reduction in heap consumed 
by temporary objects. The AspectJ 1.5.1 compiler integrated into AJDT gives memory 
savings of at least 50%. The greater savings in the AJDT environment are due to 
improvements in areas such as structure model generation that are not exercised
