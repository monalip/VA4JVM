            capabilities. AOP allows developers to reap the benefits of
            modularity for concerns that cut across the natural units of
            modularity. In object-oriented programs like Java, the natural unit
            of modularity is the class. In AspectJ, aspects modularize concerns that
            affect more than one class.

            So, in AspectJ, the execution of a method call is a join point, but
            "the execution of the expression at line 37 in file Foo.java" is
            not.

            without the full power of the feature.
          </p><p>AspectJ join points include reading or writing a field; calling
            or executing an exception handler, method or constructor.

            possible.
          </p><p>But the control that reflection provides tends to be low-level

            carefully controlled power, drawing on the rules learned from

            <span class="emphasis"><i>mixin-based inheritance</i></span>. But, in order to
            support crosscutting, a core goal for AspectJ, AspectJ goes beyond
            mixin-based inheritance.
          </p><p>Firstly, an aspect imposes behavior on a class, rather than a
            class requesting behavior from an aspect. An aspect can modify a
            class without needing to edit that class. This property is
            sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><i>reverse inheritance</i></span>.
          </p><p>Secondly, a single aspect can affect multiple classes in
            different ways. A single paint aspect can add different paint
            methods to all the classes that know how to paint, unlike mixin
            classes.
          </p><p>
So mixin-based inheritance doesn't have the reverse inheritance
property, and mixins affect every class that mixes them in the same.
If I want to do something like SubjectObserverProtocol, I need two
mixins, SubjectPartofSubjectObserverProtocol and ObserverPartof...
In AspectJ, both halves of the protocol can be captured in a single
aspect.

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e573"></a><b></b>
          Some AOP techniques are presented as "dynamic" because the weaving 
          occurs when classes are loaded, because aspects can be configured 
          in a separate XML file before launch, or because some advice
          depends on runtime reflection.  They are said to be more flexible
          than AspectJ.
          </p><p>
          This is a misconception.  First, the AspectJ 1.1 weaver has always 
          supported weaving at compile-time or class-load-time.  Weaving at
          compile-time reduces application launch and running time, and it helps
          IDE's offer support for tracking down weaving errors and understanding
          the impact of aspects on a system.
          On the other hand, weaving at load-time simplifies build and deployment.
          Before AspectJ 1.2, the user had to write a class loader that used the 
          weaver API to weave at load time; since 1.2, AspectJ comes with a 
          command-line launcher to support weaving at class-load-time without 
          any other changes to a build configuration.  In AspectJ 5, we expect
		  to get a similar level of support as AspectWerkz, and to exploit
		  the class bytecode weaving hook available in Java 5 VM's.
          </p><p>
          Second, AspectJ programs, like Java programs generally, can be
          written to support any level of XML configuration or to depend on
          runtime reflection.  There are some benefits to using AspectJ;
          e.g., the proceed() form within around advice simplifies a lot of 
          the work that otherwise would go into writing a generalized 
          interceptor, without introducing many of the runtime errors that can 
          result from interceptors.  
          For AspectJ examples of configurable or reflection-dependent programs,
          see the sample code linked off the AspectJ documentation page
          or the examples discussed on the mailing list, e.g.,

            <pre class="programlisting">
&gt; Anyone know the connections between AOP and Extreme Programming?
&gt; I am really confused. It seems AOP is a programming paradigm, which
&gt; is the next level of abstraction of OOP. Extreme Programming, however,
&gt; this is a lightweight software development process. One of the common
&gt; motivations of AOP and XP is designed to adopt to the requirement
&gt; changes, so that it can save the cost of software development.
            </pre>
          </p><p>
            This is Raymond Lee's answer:
          </p><p>
        You're not really that confused.  AOP and XP are orthogonal concepts,
        although AOP can be used to help accomplish XP goals.
        One of the goals of XP is to respond to changing requirements.
        Another is to reduce the overall cost of development.  These are
        not necessarily the same thing.
          </p><p>
        One of the principles of XP that contribute to meeting those goals
        is to maintain clean, simple designs.  One of the criteria for clean,
        simple designs is to factor out duplication from the code.  Benefits
        of removing duplication include the code being easier to understand,
        better modularity of the design, lower costs of code changes, less
        chance of conflicting changes when practicing collective code
        ownership, etc.
          </p><p>
        Different types of duplication lend themselves to being addressed by
        different design paradigms and language features.  Duplicate snippets
        of code can be factored out into methods.  Duplicate methods can be
        factored out to common classes, or pushed up to base classes.
        Duplicate patterns of methods and their use can be factored out to
        mechanisms of classes and methods (i.e. instantiations of design
        patterns).
          </p><p>
        AOP addresses a type of duplication that is very difficult to handle
        in the other common paradigms, namely cross-cutting concerns.  By
        factoring out duplicate cross-cutting code into aspects, the target
        code becomes simpler and cleaner, and the cross-cutting code becomes
        more centralized and modular.
          </p><p>
        So, AOP as a paradigm, and the associated tools, gives an XPer, or
        anyone wanting to remove duplication from the code base, a powerful
        way to remove a form of duplication not easily addressed until now.

            develop such a suite because AspectJ needs more maturation of the
            language and the coding styles first. Coding styles really drive
            the development of the benchmark suites since they suggest what is
            important to measure.
          </p><p>Though we cannot show it without a benchmark suite, we believe
          	that code generated by AspectJ has negligible performance overhead.
            Inter-type member and parent introductions should have very little
            overhead, and advice should only have some indirection which 
            could be optimized away by modern VM's.
          </p><p>The <tt>ajc</tt> compiler will use static typing information 
            to only insert the advice and dynamic pointcut tests that are absolutely necessary.  
            Unless you use 'thisJoinPoint' or 'if', the main dynamic checks will be 
            'instanceof' checks which are generally quite fast.  
            These checks will only be inserted when they can not be inferred from 
            the static type information.
          </p><p>When measuring performance, write AspectJ code
            fragments and compare them to the performance of the
            corresponding code written without AspectJ. For example, don't
            compare a method with before/after advice that grabs a lock to just
            the method. That would be comparing apples and oranges. Also be
            sure to watch out for JIT effects that come from empty method
            bodies and the like. Our experience is that they can be quite
            misleading in understanding what you've measured.
          </p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="q:modularityviolations"></a><b>4. </b>
            I've heard that AspectJ leads to modularity violations.  Does it?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e695"></a><b></b>
            Well I haven't yet seen a language in which you can't write bad code!
          </p><p>
        But seriously, most AspectJ users find that just like when they learned 
        OO, it takes a while to really get the hang of it.  They tend to start 
        in the usual way, by copying canonical examples and experimenting with 
        variations on them.
          </p><p>
        But users also find that rather than being dangerous, AspectJ helps them 
        write code that is more clear and has better encapsulation -- once they 
        understand the kind of modularity AspectJ supports.  There are several 
        good papers that talk about this (see below), but here's a basic point 
        to keep in mind: when properly used, AspectJ makes it possible program 
        in a modular way, something that would otherwise be spread throughout 
        the code. Consider the following code, adapted from the AspectJ tutorial:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PublicErrorLogging {
    Log log = new Log();

    pointcut publicInterface(Object o):
        call(public * com.xerox.*.*(..)) &amp;&amp; target(o);

    after(Object o) throwing (Error e): publicInterface(o) {
        log.write(o, e);
    }
}
          </pre><p>
        The effect of this code is to ensure that whenever any public method of 
        an interface or class in the <tt>com.xerox</tt> package 
        throws an error, that error is logged before being thrown to its caller.
          </p><p>
        Of course in the alternative implementation a large number of methods 
        have a try/catch around their body.
          </p><p>
        The AspectJ implementation of this crosscutting concern is clearly 
        modular, whereas the other implementation is not.  As a result, if you 
        want to change it, its easier in the AspectJ implementation.  For 
        example, if you also want to pass the name of the method, or its 
        arguments to <tt>log.write</tt>, you only have to edit 
        one place in the AspectJ code.
          </p><p>
        This is just a short example, but I hope it shows how what happens 
        with AOP and AspectJ is that the usual benefits of modularity are 
        achieved for crosscutting concerns, and that leads to better code, 
        not more dangerous code.
          </p><p>
        One paper someone else just reminded me of that talks some more 
        about this is:

            Why does AspectJ permit aspects to access and add members of another type?  
            Isn't that violating OO encapsulation?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e727"></a><b></b>In the spirit of Smalltalk, we have decided to give more power
            to the language in order to let the user community experiment and
            discover what is right. To date this has proven to be a successful
            strategy because it has permitted the construction of many useful
            aspects that crosscut the internal state of an object, and as such
            need access the its private members. However, we are not
            discounting that some sort of restrictions are useful, rather, we
            are seeking input from the community in order to decide on what
            these restrictions should be.
          </p><p>
            In that light, our position on encapsulation is :
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e733"></a>we respect Java's visibility rules</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e736"></a>we also provide open-classes, a mature OO technology</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e739"></a>we provide "privileged" access if you really need it.</p></li></ul></div><p>
          Introducing parents or members to classes is a well-studied OO technique
          known as open classes.
          </p><p>
          Open classes have been used in many languages prior to AspectJ, 
          including CLOS, Python, Smalltalk, Objective-C, and others.  
          Building from Java, introduction in AspectJ provides better 
          name hygiene and access control than prior languages.  
          Introduced code obeys all of Java's normal accessibility rules 
          for its lexical location in the aspect that it is introduced from.  
          Such code can not even see, much less access, private members of 
          the class it is introduced into. Further, introductions can be
          declared private to the aspect, so they are not visible to
          other clients of the class.
          </p><p>
          Privileged aspects do permit access to private members of another
          class.  They are a response to the very few cases where developers 
          genuinely need such access (typically for testing purposes where it
          access is necessary), but it would be more risky to open access by
          putting the aspect in the same package, adding test code, or changing
          access in the target class.  We recommend using privileged aspects 
          only as necessary, and believe that marking them "privileged" makes 
          any potential misuse apparent.

            Consider the component types in J2EE:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e756"></a>
                Servlet: AspectJ works well within servlets
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e759"></a>
	JSP: It is possible to use AspectJ to affect code in JSPs by precompiling
	them into Java sources and compiling these with ajc. This can be used, e.g., to 
	customize displays by turning on and off custom JSP taglibs. The mapping from a
	given jsp source to java package and class name is not standardized, which means
	doing this imposes dependencies on specific container versions.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e762"></a>
	EJB: AspectJ supports a wide variety of aspects for EJBs. It can be used for 
	logging, tracing, debugging, error handling by layers, correlated method-level
	interception (e.g., chargebacks), metering, fine-grained transactions, etc.
	Indeed, it can be used to enforce adherence to coding restrictions within an
	EJB (e.g., not using java.io, creating a class loader, or listening on 
	sockets) using <tt>declare error</tt>.
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
	The basic limitations are that there is no built-in support for writing J2EE
	analogs for AspectJ extensions to Java, like distributed aspects, distributed 
	cflow, or managing state between invocations. These don't prevent one from using
	AspectJ to do useful intra-container implementation, nor need they prevent one 
	from building distributed support, state management, and inter-component 
	implementations that leverage AspectJ. It just takes some work. In more detail:
          </p><p>
	All AspectJ implementations may define "code the implementation controls".
        The AspectJ 1.0 implementation defines this as the files passed to the compiler
        (AspectJ 1.1 will also support bytecode weaving).
          </p><p>
	Some advice on EJB operations will generate methods that confuse ejb compilers.
	To avoid this problem, you can use the -XaddSafePrefix flag when compiling with ajc.
          </p><p>
	EJB components may be invoked remotely, and containers may passivate and 
	pool EJB's.  Servlets have similar limitations, and in both cases the
	lifespan of the defining class loader is implementation-dependent 
	(though it must span the operation of a particular request).
          </p><p>
	Being limited by lifecycle and namespace, the AspectJ 1.0 implementation 
        supports aspects that operate through non-remote invocations during the lifetime 
        of the namespace for a particular 
	deployment unit compiled in its entirety by the ajc compiler.
	This means AspectJ supports common aspects only within a single local runtime
	namespace (usually implemented as a class loader hierarchy).
          </p><p>
	Further, AspectJ recognizes language-level join points (object initialization, 
	method calls, etc.), not their EJB analogs (ejb find or create methods...).
	These lead to the following consequences:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e781"></a>
	Issingleton aspects (the default) are limited to the lifetime of
	the defining class loader, which in some implementations may not span
	multiple invocations of the same application or EJB component.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e784"></a>
	EJB lifecycles are different from object lifecycles, so perthis
	and pertarget aspects will make little sense.  They do not work
        in the current implementation, which uses synchronized methods
        to ensure a correct association in threaded environments 
        (EJB's may not have synchronized methods).
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e787"></a>
	Percflow or percflowbelow aspects are restricted to a chain of
	non-remote invocations.  While EJB 2.0 permits declaring an interface
	local, this information is not available to the AspectJ compiler today.
        For same reasons as stated above fore perthis, these will not work even 
        in the EJB container.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e790"></a>
	Evaluation of cflow or cflowbelow pointcuts will be valid only
	with respect to a chain of non-remote invocations.
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
            In addition, any AspectJ code should respect EJB operations:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e796"></a>
	The EJB container accesses EJB component fields directly, i.e.,
	in code outside the control of the compiler.  There is no join point for
	these accesses, and hence no way to write a pointcut to advise that access.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e799"></a>
	The EJB container may pool EJB components, so any initialization
	join points may run once per component constructed, not once per
	component initialized for purposes of a client call.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e802"></a>
	The EJB container is permitted to change class loaders, even
	between invocations of a particular EJB component (by passivating and
	activating with a new class loader).  In this case, instances of singleton 
	aspects will not operate over multiple invocations of the component, or that 
	static initialization join point recur for a given class as it is re-loaded. 
	This behavior depends on the container implementation.

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e863"></a><b></b>
	We are working on standardization, but it's 
	a question of timing/ripeness (imagine going from thousands of users 
	to millions).  (See <a href="#q:standardization">Q:What are your plans to make AspectJ a general feature of Java supported by Sun and the other key-players in the Java Industry?</a>.) We believe 
	AspectJ addresses this question in the best way possible now:
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e869"></a>
	It's open-source.  Rather than being proprietary or controlled by a

                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e872"></a>
	AspectJ is not a set of mechanisms, it's a language.  It is currently

	runs in any compliant J2SE VM and supports standard debuggers for those VM's 
	that support JSR-45 (debugging support for multi-language/multi-file sources).  
	This is a huge benefit to Sun since Sun must be extremely cautious 
	about extensions to the language or VM; before adopting AOP, Sun should 
	demand the kind of actual-proof that AspectJ implementations offer.

	On the issue of "proprietary mechanisms to describe pointcuts, etc.":   Any AOP 
	has to have some language to describe pointcuts and the like ("pointcuts" 
	of course being the AspectJ term).  Users would like to have one language 
	(to avoid having to learn or transform between many languages) and the 
	choice of multiple implementations (tailored for a configuration, subject 
	to competitive pressure, etc.).  That's what AspectJ offers.

	That said, we believe the AspectJ extensions to Java could form the basis

            Do I have to use the AspectJ compiler?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e952"></a><b></b> The AspectJ compiler or weaver is required at some point, but
                many people can use AspectJ without changing their build or
                deployment process significantly. For aspects that are not
                required to compile, you can use the AspectJ binary weaver, run
                at build-time or class-load-time. You can write aspects using
                the original code style (which must be compiled with the AspectJ
                compiler) or using the annotation style new in AspectJ 5 (which
                may be compiled with Javac or the AspectJ compiler). </p><p>

            What files do I need to include when compiling AspectJ programs?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e963"></a><b></b>You need to specify to the compiler the files that
            contain your aspects and the files that contain the 
            types affected by your aspects.
	    See <a href="#q:knowWhenAspectsAffectClasses">Q: How do I know which aspects affect a class when looking at that class's source code?</a>.
	    The AspectJ compiler will not search the source path for types
	    that may be affected (unlike Javac and Jikes).
	    In AspectJ 1.0, ajc requires all code to be in source form;
	    in AspectJ 1.1, Java and AspectJ code may be in either source
	    or binary form.  
          </p><p>In some cases you should compile your entire system all at once.
           If this is too slow, then you can try to make reasonable divisions
           between sets of source files whose aspects do not interact to 
           achieve a shorter compile cycle (particularly for development 
	       aspects).  If you have aspects that apply to different modules,
	       you can try compiling them into a binary form and using them
	       to weave each module.  However, if you get any problems
           or if you wish to run tests or do a release, you should recompile
           the entire system.

            can find to run it on, the shorter your compile times will be. At a

            I noticed the AspectJ compiler doesn't use a parser generator.  Why is that?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e1200"></a><b></b>In AspectJ 1.0,
          the PARSER for ajc is written by hand.  This choice was made with full 
          awareness of the generator tools out there.  (Jim had for example used 
          the excellent javacc tool for building the parser for JPython (now Jython)).  
          One of the reasons that AspectJ uses a hand-written parser is that using 
          javacc taught Jim about the LL-k design for parsers (pioneered by antlr).  
          As opposed to the state-machine parsers produced by yacc, these parsers are 
          very readable and writable by humans.
          </p><p>
            Antlr and javacc did not really suit the project:
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e1206"></a>
            Antlr's support for unicode in the lexer is still immature and this makes 
            using it with Java challenging.  This was an even bigger issue 3 years ago 
            when we started on the Java implementation of ajc.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1209"></a>
            While javacc is freely available, it is not Open Source.  Depending on a 
            closed-source tool to build an Open Source compiler would reduce some 
            of the transparency and control of open-source.
              </p></li></ul></div><p>
          There were also several things that were easier to implement with 
          a hand-written parser than with any of the exiting tools.
          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e1215"></a>
            Semi-keywords -- it's important to us that 
            "every legal Java program is also a legal AspectJ program."  
            This wouldn't be true if we made 'before' and 'call' full keywords in 
            AspectJ.  It is easier to support these sorts of semi-keywords with a 
            hand-written parser.  (Note: ajc-1.0.x handles 'aspect' and 'pointcut' 
            slightly specially which can break a few unusual pure Java programs.  
            This is a compiler limitation that will be fixed in a future release.)
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1218"></a>
            Deprecated syntax warnings -- the syntax of AspectJ 
            changed many times from version 0.2 to the 1.0 release.  It was easier 
            to provide helpful warning messages for these changes with our 
            hand-written parser.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1221"></a>
            Grammar modularity -- We like being able to have 
            AspectJParser extend JavaParser.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1224"></a> 
            Part of the grammar for AspectJ is extremely hard for existing tools to 
            capture. This is the type pattern syntax, i.e. "com.xerox..*.*(..)".  
            The sort of case that gives standard parser generators fits is something 
            like "*1.f(..)" which no one would ever write, but which must be 
            supported for a consistent language.
              </p><p>
              In AspectJ 1.1, the parser was written as it is for the underlying
              Eclipse compiler,
              with some hand-coding of the sort that avoids adding keywords to
              the language.

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e1233"></a><b></b>In incremental mode, ajc minimizes the files that need
                  to be recompiled after another file has changed.  In Java,
                  only the changed files need to be recompiled, but in AspectJ,
                  other files might also need to be recompiled or re-woven.
              </p><p> Depending on what is modified, we may need to re-weave
                    code. &nbsp;If you change a pointcut and save it, we currently have
                    to check everywhere in case a new match is occurring or an old
                    match is no longer correct. &nbsp;However, if you simply change
                    the body of an advice in an aspect, there is (usually) no need
                    to reweave as the affected classes call the advice and the
                    advice (by design) maintains its name in the recompiled
                    aspect. </p><p> If you make a change to a class (as opposed to an aspect) and
                    save it, we usually can get away with merely having to
                    compile that class then weave the existing aspects with it -
                    rather than doing a full recompile of the entire system.
                    </p><p> There are a lot of possible optimizations to the
                    algorithms we use, by performing more complete analysis of
                    the change made to a file that will enable us to know more
                    accurately whether we need to reweave and if we do then what
                    we need to reweave - we just haven't gotten around to

             The compiler will list the static code points which will be 
             affected by any advice specifying the same pointcut.
             For example, the following will print a warning
             whereever some code in class Bar gets a field value from Foo:
             <pre class="programlisting">
  declare warning: get(* Foo.*) &amp;&amp; within(Bar) 
     : "reading Foo state from Bar";

            When you are running your program,
            you can trace advice as it executes.  This
            enables you to identify advice on join points picked out 
            dynamically, which cannot be reflected precisely by IDE support.

            We compile module jars and then assemble them.  Can we continue this with AspectJ?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e1396"></a><b></b>
		Aspects apply to everything in a namespace, as if everything is 
		compiled together.
		Sometimes you can break the build down into separate steps without breaking 
		this model, but we haven't stated exactly where it could break
		because it depends on the interactions between all types.
		You can try the approaches below, but remember to rebuild 
		everything in one go if there are problems.
		</p><p>
		The simplest scenario is when the aspects apply to all modules
		and the modules compile without the aspects.  In that case,
		weaving in the aspects is just the final assembly step for
		the build.
		</p><p>
		Next is the case where the aspects make changes to a common
		library that are visible to other clients, which themselves
		are otherwise unaffected by the aspects.  In this case, the
		common library can be built using ajc, and used on the 
		classpath for the module builds:
		<pre class="programlisting">

   ajc -outjar common.jar -sourceroots "aspectj-src:src" ...
   cd ../otherProject
   javac -classpath "../common/common.jar:${aspectjrt.jar}" {src}

		</pre>
		</p><p>
		Combining these last two, 
		there's the case where a common set of aspects should
		affect two or more modules that are in a dependency relationship
		to one another.  It should work to reuse the aspects 
		in binary form for each compile, in dependency order:
		
		<pre class="programlisting">

   ajc -outjar common-aspects.jar
       -sourceroots "aspectj-src" ...

   ajc -outjar common.jar
       -sourceroots "src"
       -aspectpath common-aspects.jar ...

   cd ../module1
   ajc -outjar module1.jar
       -sourceroots "src"
       -classpath common.jar
       -aspectpath ../common-aspects.jar ...

   cd ../module2
   ajc -outjar module2.jar
       -sourceroots "src"
       -classpath "common.jar;../module1.jar"
       -aspectpath ../common-aspects.jar ...

		</pre>   
		</p><p>
		If two modules are visibly affected by aspects and
		mutually-dependent, the only thing to do is compile
		them together.
		</p><p>
		It's safest to assume that all aspects can affect all
		types in a namespace; using build boundaries to effect
		crosscutting limits causes a dangerous dependency on
		the build process and might cause problems.
		</p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="q:incrementalModuleCompiles"></a><b>7. </b>We use modules and would like to use incremental compilation.

			Just incrementally-compile the whole system.
			Specify to ajc the modules as multiple source roots  
			(or input jars if you are weaving libraries).
			</p><p>
			In Eclipse's AJDT, you can create a top-level project with symbolic 
			links out to the sources:
			
			<pre class="programlisting">

   app-assembly/
	 {link common/aspects}
	 {link common/src}
	 {link module1/src}
	 ...

			</pre>   
			
			Then everything is part of one huge incremental compile.  Also, you
			can close this master project and work the others using the Java
			compiler or AJDT.
			</p><p>
			The links make incremental development possible without affecting
			the modularized Ant builds.  (Our practice runs along those lines.)

            What is the difference between call and execution join points?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e1486"></a><b></b>
	    Briefly, there are two interesting times when a constructor or method is
	    run.  Those times are when it is called, and when it actually
	    executes.
          </p><p>
	    The main difference is that a call join point happens outside of
	    the target object (for non-static methods) or class (for static methods
	    and constructors), and that an execution join point happens inside
	    the object or class.  This means that the <tt>within</tt>
	    and <tt>withincode</tt> pointcuts pick them out
	    differently: A call join point is picked out within the caller,
	    while an execution join point is picked
	    out where it is actually defined.
          </p><p>
	    A call join point is the ``outermost'' join point for a particular
	    call.  Once a call join point proceeds, then a number of different
	    things happen.  For non-static methods, for example, method
	    dispatch happens, which will cause one method execution join point
	    -- perhaps more, if there are super calls.  For constructors, the
	    super constructor is called, and fields are initialized, and then
	    various constructor execution join points will occur.
          </p><p>
	    A call join point matches only the ``external'' calls of a method
	    or constructor, based on a signature, and it does not pick out
	    calls made with <tt>super</tt>, or
	    <tt>this</tt> constructor calls.
          </p><p>Here's more detail:
          </p><p>Consider method execution in Java as (1) the initial call from
                this object to some method on the target object with a
                particular signature; and (2) the execution of the actual code
                in the particular method dispatched in the target object.
                The call join point starts with the initial call and ends 
                when control returns to the call (by return or perhaps 
                thrown exception).  The execution join point starts with
                the method body and ends when the body completes (again
                by return or throwing an exception), so the execution join
                point always happens within the bounds of the corresponding
                call join point.  You can see this if you use the
	        join-point tracing aspect in see <a href="#q:seeingjoinpoints">Q:I don't understand what join points exist.  How can I see them?</a>.
          </p><p>As you would expect, the context differs 
                in advice on pointcuts picking out execution and call join
                points; for call, <tt>this</tt> refers to the caller, whereas 
                for execution <tt>this</tt> refers to the called 
                (executing) object.
          </p><p>
	There are some subtle interactions with other AspectJ semantics.
	First, the meaning of the signature in the
	<tt>execution()</tt> and <tt>call()</tt>
	pointcut designators (PCD's) differ: the call type depends upon
	the type of the reference making the call, while the execution
	type depends on the enclosing class.
        Second, you may choose one over another if you cannot bring all
	your sources within the code the compiler controls
	(described in the <a href="progguide/semantics.html" target="_top">appendix</a>
     to the <tt>Programming Guide</tt>).
	For example, to trace calls into a 
	method from classes which are outside the code the compiler controls
	at compile time, then using <tt>execution()</tt> will work
	while using <tt>call()</tt>may not.  Finally, since 
	<tt>super</tt> invocations are not considered method calls,
	to trace <tt>super.foo()</tt> would require using
	<tt>execution</tt>.
          </p><p>
          		Because of differences in the way AspectJ 1.0 and 1.1
          		are implemented, in 1.0
                you should use the <tt>call()</tt> 
                pointcut designator unless you have a good reason to use
	        <tt>execution()</tt>; in AspectJ 1.1, the 
	        reverse is true.

        Ordinarily, using a <tt>call</tt> pointcut designator 
        is best because the call join point surrounds the others, but in
        the case of constructors there is no target object for
        the call (because it has not been constructed yet), so you
        might prefer to use the <tt>initialization</tt>

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e1615"></a><b></b>
          You can advise some form of constructor join point.
          Constructors are tricky in Java, and that's exposed in AspectJ.  
          Here are some rules of thumb:
          <div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e1619"></a>If you want the join point on the "outside" of object creation, 
              use after returning from call to the constructor:

    after() returning (Foo newlyCreatedObject): call(Foo.new(..)) { ... }
              </pre><p>
  You might be tempted to use "this" or "target" to expose the new object, but remember
  that if you're on the "outside" of object creation, the object itself might not be
  created yet... it only exists "on the way out", when you return the object.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1626"></a>If you want the join point inside a particular constructor, use:
              </p><pre class="programlisting">
    after(Foo newlyCreatedObject) returning: this(newlyCreatedObject) &amp;&amp; execution(Foo.new(..)) { ... }
              </pre><p>
    Remember, though, that if you use "before" advice here, the body of the constructor
    will not have run, and so the object may be somewhat uninitialized.
              </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1633"></a>
    In the rare case that there are all sorts of constructors for the object that call 
    each other with <tt>this(...)</tt> and you want exactly one join point 
    for each initialization of <tt>Foo</tt>, regardless of the path of 
    constructors it takes, then use:
              </p><pre class="programlisting">
    after(Foo f) returning: this(f) &amp;&amp; initialization(Foo.new(..)) { ... }
              </pre></li></ul></div>

            I want advice to run at two join points, but it doesn't run at all.  What gives?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e1649"></a><b></b>
	  This usually reflects both a conceptual error and a programming mistake.
	  Most likely you want to do something like "run the advice for all 
	public and private calls," and the code looks something like this:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
            within(com.xerox.printing..*) &amp;&amp; call(public * *(..)) &amp;&amp; call(private * *(..))
          </pre><p>
	But a pointcut is evaluated at *each* join point.
        The expression above would never pick out any call join point,
	because no method signature has both public and private access.
	In a pointcut, <tt>pc1() &amp;&amp; pc2()</tt> means both
	must be true at a given join point for advice to run at that join point.
	The correct pointcut would use <tt>||</tt> as follows:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
            within(com.xerox.printing..*) &amp;&amp; (call(public * *(..)) || call(private * *(..)))
          </pre><p>
            Then the advice will run at the join point.

          	in the join point context, which you can use as a per-class key. 
          	Then you can actually declare an instance field to contain
          	the per-class value (see the next question).  This comes at
          	the cost of an extra reference, but the field can be final.

          </p><p>In AspectJ 1.1, the String concatenation operator (+) is
          	advised in its StringBuffer form, so if your advise uses 
          	String + in a way that is picked out by your pointcut,
          	you will get infinite recursion.</p><p>
          (1) Use <tt>after returning</tt> to advise normal completions
              or <tt>after throwing</tt> to advise abrupt completions.
              If you use <tt>after</tt> or <tt>after throwing</tt>, 
              write the advice with the same care you would a finally clause, 
              understanding that it may run after some failure.
          </p><p>(2) Avoid writing advice that advises itself.  One simple way to
          do so is to exclude the code within the current aspect:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">

          </pre><p>A better way is often to re-write the pointcut.  
          If the advice is advising itself accidentally, that's a sign that 
          the pointcut is not saying what you mean.

        When working with an unsupported IDE that objects to the syntax of

        in a source tree as Java files based on the .java extension), 
        you can use the .aj extension for your AspectJ files.  
        The ajc compiler accepts both .java and .aj files, and you can 
        set up your build scripts to include the correct list of 
        source files.  (You will have to find another editor for
        editing AspectJ files; you can use the ajbrowser to view
        edit your AspectJ files and navigate the crosscutting structure.)
          </p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="q:idememory"></a><b>8. </b>I used to be able to compile my program in my IDE, but when I

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e2028"></a><b></b>
        The ajc compiler does more analysis than (e.g.,) javac,
        and AJDE may in some IDE's hold a copy of the structure tree until the
        next tree is available from the compile process.  Both mean that you may
        need extra memory to compile the same program.  However, increasing
        available memory to the point that you are swapping to disk can
        slow the process considerably.
          </p><p>
        If you are having problems and would like to find the optimal memory 
        allocation, iteratively decrease the amount of memory available until 
        AJDE or ajc signals out-of-memory errors, and then increase that 
        amount by 5-10%.
          </p><p>
        To increase memory for the ajc compiler, see <a href="#q:ajcoom">Q:The AspectJ compiler aborts with an OutOfMemoryError when compiling many classes. How can I fix this?</a>.
        For your IDE, do something similar or follow the provider's instructions.
        For example, to increase memory in JBuilder, edit the 
        <tt>jbuilderX/bin/jbuilder.config</tt>
        file to have an entry like:
<pre class="programlisting">        
vmparam -Xmx384m
</pre>        
          </p><p>
        If it turns out that your project is too big to use with AJDE, your IDE 
        may nonetheless support external commands or Ant build processes, which
        run outside the IDE memory space.  For a JBuilder Ant plugin, some

            My advice is not running (or running twice), and I don't know why.
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e2114"></a><b></b>
          	When advice is not running,   
          	there is probably a problem in the pointcut.
          Sometimes users specify pointcuts that 
          do not mean what they intend -
	      most often when they misspell a type name. Run the compiler in
	      <tt>-Xlint</tt> mode, which will flag some likely mistakes,
	      like the type name.  
          If that does not work, and your pointcut is staticly-determinable,
          use a declare statement to identify affected code.  (For more 
          information, see <a href="#q:knowWhenAspectsAffectClasses">Q: How do I know which aspects affect a class when looking at that class's source code?</a>.)
          If that does not work and your pointcut is dynamically determined, 
          see if your join points are executing at all by using
              TraceJoinPoints.java from <a href="#q:seeingjoinpoints">Q:I don't understand what join points exist.  How can I see them?</a>.
          </p><p>When advice is running more than it should, either
          	(1) your advice is in an abstract aspect and the pointcut picks
          	out the same join point for more than one concrete instantiation
          	of the aspect, or
          	(2) your pointcut picks out more join points than you intend.
          </p><p>
          In the case of advice in abstract aspects, the advice will run once
          for each concrete instance of the aspect. 
          If the pointcut for that advice picks out the same join point for two 
          concrete aspects, then the correct behavior is for the advice to run 
          the advice twice at that join point.
          </p><p>
          To see if your pointcut picks out the join points you intend, you
          can use IDE support, logging, or declare-warnings.
          If you are using IDE support, you should be able to trace back from
          the pointcut or advice to the join points which can be statically
          determined to be affected.  
          Without IDE support, you can write
          declare-warning statements to identify code affected by staticly-
          determinable pointcuts.
          To identify advised dynamic join points,
          you can try using <tt>TraceJoinPoints.java</tt> as above, 
          or update the advice to print the source location of the join point.  
          Doing any of these should show if the advice applies to code that 
          you did not expect.
          </p><p>If you've done this and convinced yourself it's not working,
          it may be a bug.  See <a href="#q:bugreports">Q:How do I submit a bug report?</a>.

	  So the semantic model of advice is like the semantic model of a

          </p><p>
	  People who worked with earlier versions of AspectJ, in which ajc
	  was very explicitly a pre-processor, sometimes thought of AspectJ

          </p><p>
	  This distinction is important for two reasons.  One is that thinking
          about it this way will make more sense at the implementation continues
          to evolve towards load-time or runtime weaving.  The other is that
          it makes it much easier to understand the semantics of advice on
          cflow pointcuts.

              there are no significant hidden uses of memory.  As would be expected,

              <tt>pertarget</tt> or <tt>perthis</tt>)

              When referencing the static part of a join point (e.g., 
              <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt>), only one object is

			  implement <tt>static {AspectClass} aspectOf()</tt>, so 
			  singleton instances will not be garbage collected until the class is.
			  For long-running or memory-critical programs, consider using weak 
			  references in singleton aspects for state that should be garbage collected.
		  </p><p>Finally, when using load-time weaving, the weaver can require
              memory in its own right.  Because the class loader never can 
              know when it is done loading classes, the weaver can hold on
              to the aspects required to weave for some time.  There are 
              strategies for minimizing this (with different trade-off's),
              so the time and memory required for load-time weaving will
              vary as load-time weaving evolves.

          that all routes to a jump destination must have the same height stack when they get there,
          regardless of the route taken to get there through the bytecode.  The CGLIB generated code has different
          stack heights at the various exit points.  This is not a problem with the CGLIB generated code,
          it is perfectly valid - it is just unusual and the AspectJ weaving strategy causes the

          </p><p>
            AspectJ has come a long way -- the language has
            stabilized; there are a rapidly growing number of
            commercial users; the 1.1 release is imminent and will
            include byte-code weaving and incremental compilation;
            and the tool support is now well integrated with several
            major IDEs. 
          </p><p>
            This growth of the community and the technology means
            that the original research and prototype development of
            AspectJ is complete. As such it is time for ongoing
            development and support of AspectJ to move outside of
            PARC. This has already started to happen; the Eclipse
            AJDT plug-in and the several books in preparation are
            examples. 
          </p><p>
            To encourage the growth of the AspectJ technology and
            community, PARC is transferring AspectJ to an
            openly-developed eclipse.org project. This project will
            include documentation, web site, mailing lists, bug
            database, and sources for the compiler. The
            command-line AspectJ compiler is still the primary tool
            produced by this project, in addition to APIs that support
            integration with a variety of IDEs. The Eclipse plug-in will
            remain at eclipse.org, while the NetBeans, JBuilder and
            Emacs support will move to SourceForge.net projects.
            We look forward to your involvement with and
            contribution to those projects. 
          </p><p>
            We see Eclipse as an excellent new home for core
            AspectJ technology development -- it is an active
            community of Open Source development and innovation
            in the Java space. Once development moves to
            Eclipse.org, others will be able to contribute more easily.

                but is distributed standalone and can run standalone.
                With the AspectJ distribution, you can compile and run

          </p><p>AJDT is an eclipse project to integrate AspectJ

		  experience - searching, compiler-error tasks, etc.
		  AJDT will use the AspectJ Development Environment (AJDE)
		  API's for creating IDE integrations, as well as hooking
		  in to the model underlying the Java compiler.
          </p><p>Similarly, Sourceforge has projects integrating

              AspectJ for NetBeans</a>.
          </p><p>This is the right level of separation/integration.  
          AspectJ is available standalone, leverages an existing open-source
          compliant Java compiler, and supports external projects 
          doing IDE integrations in Eclipse, Emacs, JBuilder, and NetBeans
          through a common API, AJDE.

            Should I use code- or annotation-style aspects?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e2520"></a><b></b>
            To use AspectJ, you can use the original code-style aspects
            or the annotation-style aspects new in AspectJ 5.  
          </p><p>
            The original code-style is a small extension of the Java language
            designed to express crosscutting as clearly as possible
            in ways familiar to most Java programmers.
            To use the original code-style aspects,
            compile them with the AspectJ compiler or weave
            pre-compiled binary aspects using the AspectJ binary (.class)
            weaver, either at build-time or at class-load-time.
            Code-style aspects have excellent IDE support, allowing
            you to navigate to and from affected source code.
          </p><p>
            Annotation-style
            aspects are written (not surprisingly) using annotations.
            They use the subset of the AspectJ language that works
            when aspects are woven after the code is compiled.
            The source files are compiled with Javac, which simply saves the 
            annotations in the .class files.  The resulting .class files
              must be woven using
            the AspectJ weaver, which reads the annotations from the
            .class file and uses them to define aspects.
            Annotation-style aspects have the benefit of being compilable
              by Javac, but you can't use the full AspectJ language,
              and you don't enjoy the same level of IDE support
              for viewing crosscutting structure.

              While the AspectJ weaver could be used at load-time in previous

              an XML file for configuration that allows deployers to declare
              concrete aspects using only XML.  This means aspect developers
              can write abstract aspects, and deployers need only configure
              <tt>aop.xml</tt> and run using the AspectJ weaver in Java 5.

          <a href="progguide/index.html" target="_top">Programming Guide</a>.
          However, current implementations do not control everything in
          a system, so AspectJ program semantics may be limited to code
          the implementation controls.  For our implementation, these 
          limitations are stated in 
          <a href="progguide/implementation.html" target="_top">
             Programming Guide Appendix:  Implementation Notes</a>.
		  Aside from understanding the use and limitations of the

          </p><p>
          The technology that implements AspectJ interests 
          some academic researchers and some developers 
          who want new features or new ways to weave.
          These extensions are not discussed in the documentation.
          Some are being developed already,
          others are on the drawing board (or perhaps were left off
          long ago), and still others haven't been considered.
		  If you are interested in a certain extension, 
          check the bug database for feature requests
          and the mailing list archives for any past discussions.
		  Then email the list to see if it's been considered.

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e2575"></a><b></b>
          There are currently no documents describing this process in detail.  
          You can compile programs and inspect the generated source or bytecode,
          or view the source code (see <a href="#Developers">AspectJ Project Development</a>).
          We hope to write papers on the bytecode weaving model used in 
          AspectJ-1.1 if we can find the time.
          Erik Hilsdale and Jim Hugunin did draft a paper for AOSD 2004,
          now available on Jim's web site:
          <a href="http://hugunin.net/papers.html" target="_top">
          	http://hugunin.net/papers.html</a>
          Jim summarized advice weaving in the AspectJ 1.1 implementation in the
          <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/aspectj-dev/msg00519.html" target="_top">
          	following mailing-list reply</a>:
          </p><p>
			Each piece of advice in an aspect is associated with a pointcut.  
			This pointcut is stored in an attribute on the methods 
			corresponding to each piece of advice.  
			Before weaving, all of these pieces of advice are gathered 
			into one large list.
          </p><p>
			Each .class file is woven independently.  
			A .class file is woven by the following steps:
			<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e2591"></a>
					Collect all of the joinpoint shadows in the .class file.  
					For every dynamic joinpoint in the AspectJ language model, 
					there is a corresponding static shadow of that joinpoint 
					in the bytecode.  
					For example, every method call joinpoint has an INVOKE 
					bytecode as its static shadow.  Some joinpoints 
					(such as initialization) have much more 
					complicated static shadows.
				</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2594"></a>
					Each piece of advice is matched to each static shadow.  
					There are three results possible from this match.
					<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e2598"></a>
							Never matches,
							in which case nothing is done to the shadow
						</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2601"></a>
							Always matches, 
							in which case the advice is woven into this joinpoint shadow
						</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2604"></a>
							Sometimes matches,
							in which case the advice is woven into the shadow 
							along with the minimal dynamic tests to determine 
							if any particular joinpoint in the actual running 
							program matches the advice. 
							The simplest example of sometimes matches is 
							when the pointcut uses if(test()).
						</p></li></ul></div>
				</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e2608"></a>
					If any advice matched any static shadows in the .class file, 
					then the transformed .class file is written out, 
					otherwise it is left unchanged.
				</p></li></ul></div>

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e2627"></a><b></b>You have two choices based on how wide you want the weaving to take effect: application-server wide and application-specific weaving. 
          You choose between the two by loading aspect artifacts--aspects, associated types, and aop.xml--through the right classloader. 
          The aop.xml must be in the META-INF directory on the classpath for the chosen classloader. In either case, you modify the 
          startup script to specify the -javaagent:path-to/aspectjweaver.jar option to the Java virtual machine. Note that it is not 
          essential that all the artifacts be placed in a single jar.  
          </p><p>For application-server wide weaving, you make aspect artifacts accessible to the server's classloader. Typically, you 
          achieve such access by putting these artifacts in the server's lib directory. For example, for Tomcat, you will place 
          the aspect artifacts in the TOMCAT_HOME/lib directory.</p><p>For application-specific weaving, you make aspect artifacts accessible to application classloader by bundling 
		  them along with application's classes. For example, for a web application, you will place the aspect artifacts in 
		  the MY_APP/WEB-INF/lib and/or MY_APP/WEB-INF/classes directory.</p><p>
		  We recommend that you start with application-specific weaving.
          Note that you have an additional option if your application is based on the Spring framework. If you deploy in one of 
          the supported web servers or application servers, you can avoid modifications to the startup script. Please 
          see <a href="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html#aop-aj-ltw-spring" target="_top">http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html#aop-aj-ltw-spring</a> for more details.

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e2643"></a><b></b>
          The only time that reflection is used during run-time is when the special 
          thisJoinPoint object is used to discover reflective information about the 
          join point.  If you don't use thisJoinPoint then no reflection will be used.
          </p></div></div><div class="qandaentry"><div class="question"><p><a name="q:loadtimeWeaving"></a><b>5. </b>What about load-time weaving? Can I weave aspects at runtime?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e2650"></a><b></b>
          Since the 1.1 release, AspectJ can weave binary aspects
          into classes in bytecode form.  Hooked up to a class loader,
          this can weave class bytecodes after they are read in,
          before the
          class is defined by the VM.  (This means load-time weaving
          only works were aspects are not required to compile the pure-java
          classes.  If the aspects are required, then the Java classes
          have to be compiled with the aspects using the AspectJ compiler.)
              The AspectJ 1.2 release had the
              WeavingURLClassLoader, and the 1.2.1 release introduced
              the aj.bat script for Java 1.4.
              The AspectJ 5 release introduces much better support for
              load-time weaving, including declaring concrete aspects
              in XML files and integrating with Java 5 and BEA JRocket
              JVM's.  See <a href="#q:aspectj5ltw">Q:What's new about the load-time weaving support in AspectJ 5?</a>.
          </p><p>Some have asked about only weaving particular classes 
          specified at run-time.
		  Aspects should work across an entire namespace, and problems 
		  will likely result from weaving
          some classes but not others.  Also, it's confusing to 
          specify crosscutting both in the aspect and in the
          list of runtime classes; the crosscutting specification
          should be in the aspect itself,
          where it can be processed by tools.
          </p><p>And just to state the obvious:
          do not use bytecode weaving, at load-time or otherwise,
          to modify .class files protected by license,
          without permission from the licensor.

                 The quality of the mailing lists makes a huge difference
                 in the ability of new and experienced AspectJ users
                 to write good code.  For guidance on effective

                 Also, the time that experienced users take in answering emails
                 can directly translate to time developers can use (instead)
                 for fixing bugs or adding features.

              If you particularly need a bug to be fixed, or if you're interested in

              declare your intentions and the approach you propose (based on having
              looked at the code).
              Mailing the list gives those experienced with the code a chance to
              guide you away from pitfalls.  To submit the patch, attach it to
              the bug.  (When creating patches, do so on a per-module basis; that 
              means if fixing the bug involves changes to three modules, submit
              three patches.)

              Often documentation needs to be fixed, or there may be a small new 
              feature you'd like to see.  You can just do it and then submit it
              as a patch to a bug you create.  As with bugs, in some cases you
              might want to declare your intentions on the mailing list to avoid
              wasting time on something that's been fixed but not committed or
              on an approach that will be fruitless.

          The code of course should replicate the actual behavior

          If you have a single source file, you can attach it directly,
          describing in the comments the expected result
          (e.g., error on line 14, or successful compile/run).
          The most helpful form for describing the test scenario

          create a zip file of a directory containing all the files

          for how to compile, recompile, or run the test sources.

          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e3215"></a><b></b>
	The best compiler bug report is a reproducible test case, 
	standalone code that demonstrates the problem.
	Sometimes with aspects, a test case requires several 
	files, if not some way to capture the behavior.
	Here's how we recommend submitting test cases:
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e3219"></a>
	Write the test case so that when the compiler bug 
  	is fixed, the test completes normally without output
  	(e.g., expected compiler errors are issued,
   	or classes produced run correctly).  This usually
    means writing one or more source files.
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e3222"></a>
	In the bug report, briefly summarize the bug.
	If it is not obvious, be sure to specify 
	the expected output/behavior (e.g., compiler error on line 32)
	and, if the compile should complete, the main class to run.
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e3225"></a>

            Project mean to me?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e3288"></a><b></b>Open source protects your interest in a correct, long-lived,
		up-to-date, and widely-accepted implementation of AspectJ.
            <div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e3292"></a>With the source code, you control your own destiny
                in perpetuity.  You can continue to use the implementation
		and update it as necessary to fix bugs and add things you need.
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e3295"></a>Because the code is available to all, anyone can find
		and fix bugs.  There is no need to hope for it to be fixed
		in the next product release.  Those who encounter the bugs
		are motivated to fix them, and there are more eyeballs on 
		the code than in closed-source, so the quality tends to be high.
		This can be particularly true for the AspectJ community,
		which tends to be highly skilled.
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e3298"></a>The same is true of new features or behavior, so the
		implementation should be up-to-date.  This is important as
		the field of AOP develops, to capture the latest solutions.
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e3301"></a>For a programming language which forms the basis of 
		an entire solution stack, open source facilitates the kind
		of adoption -- tool integrations and significant projects --
		that develop and prove the technology for wider adoption.  This 
		limits delays caused by waiting for the completion of standards 
		process or promulgation by industry leaders, and also provides
	        the proofs necessary for such adoption.

            of Java supported by Sun and the other key players in the Java
            Industry?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e3309"></a><b></b>Although we are committed to making AspectJ available to a wide
            range of users, it is too early to decide on a strategy. Some
            options include continuing AspectJ as a stand-alone product,
            integrating it into IDEs, or possibly incorporating it into
            standard Java with Sun's blessing.
          </p><p>We currently focus on developing for the 1.1 implementation 
            which improves AspectJ in key areas: rapid
            incremental compilation, bytecode weaving, and IDE integration.
          </p><p>Through all of this our goal is to make AspectJ integrate as
            seamlessly as possible with the Java programming language. The
            AspectJ language design is becoming more integrated, the compiler
            is becoming faster and more integrated, the IDE extensions are
            becoming more integrated. All of this is designed to help users
            really use AspectJ and give us feedback on it.
          </p><p>As the system is improved and we work more closely
            with users, we will be in good position to explore the best path
            for AspectJ in the long term.

	        When will it work at class-loading time?
          </p></div><div class="answer"><p><a name="d0e3322"></a><b></b>Bytecode weaving is in AspectJ 1.1.  We believe it
	   works as described in an email to the users list by Jim Hugugin:
          </p><p>
              The AspectJ language was designed to support weaving at many different times: 
              compile, load, or even run-time in the JVM.  Weaving into bytecodes at both 
              compile and load-time will definitely be provided in a future release.  This 
              will allow weaving at compile-time into libraries for which source code is 
              not available.  It will also support aspect-aware class loaders that can 
              perform weaving at load time on arbitrary classes.  One advantage of a 
              language like AspectJ, rather than an explicit meta-tool like jiapi, is 
              that it separates the specification of a crosscutting concern from any 
              particular implementation strategy for weaving.
          </p><p>
              ...AspectJ provides a language that can cleanly 
              capture crosscutting concerns while preserving the static type checking, 
              modularity, and composability of Java.
          </p><p>If you have an application for using aspects and bytecode, 
              please let the AspectJ team know of your requirements.
              We expect to have a demonstration classloader available in
              the 1.1 release or soon thereafter.
