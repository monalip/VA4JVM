      An aspect is a crosscutting type defined by the <tt>aspect</tt>
      declaration. 
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="aspect-declaration"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aspect-declaration"></a>Aspect Declaration</h3></div></div><p>
        The <tt>aspect</tt> declaration is similar to the
	<tt>class</tt> declaration in that it defines a type and an
	implementation for that type. It differs in a number of
	ways:
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7030"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7030"></a>Aspect implementation can cut across other types</h4></div></div><p> In addition to normal Java class declarations such as
	methods and fields, aspect declarations can include AspectJ
	declarations such as advice, pointcuts, and inter-type
	declarations.  Thus, aspects contain implementation
	declarations that can can cut across other types (including those defined by
	other aspect declarations).
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7035"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7035"></a>Aspects are not directly instantiated</h4></div></div><p> Aspects are not directly instantiated with a new
	expression, with cloning, or with serialization. Aspects may
	have one constructor definition, but if so it must be of a
	constructor taking no arguments and throwing no checked
	exceptions.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7040"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7040"></a>Nested aspects must be <tt>static</tt></h4></div></div><p> 
	  Aspects may be defined either at the package level, or as a static nested
          aspect -- that is, a static member of a class, interface, or aspect.  If it
          is not at the package level, the aspect <span class="emphasis"><i>must</i></span> be
          defined with the static keyword.  Local and anonymous aspects are not
          allowed.
        </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="aspect-extension"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aspect-extension"></a>Aspect Extension</h3></div></div><p>
        To support abstraction and composition of crosscutting concerns,
        aspects can be extended in much the same way that classes can. Aspect
        extension adds some new rules, though.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7055"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7055"></a>Aspects may extend classes and implement interfaces</h4></div></div><p>
          An aspect, abstract or concrete, may extend a class and may implement
          a set of interfaces. Extending a class does not provide the ability
          to instantiate the aspect with a new expression: The aspect may still
          only define a null constructor.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7060"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7060"></a>Classes may not extend aspects</h4></div></div><p>
          It is an error for a class to extend or implement an aspect.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7065"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7065"></a>Aspects extending aspects
        </h4></div></div><p>
          Aspects may extend other aspects, in which case not only are fields
          and methods inherited but so are pointcuts. However, aspects may only
          extend abstract aspects. It is an error for a concrete aspect to
          extend another concrete aspect.
        </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="aspect-instantiation"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aspect-instantiation"></a>Aspect instantiation</h3></div></div><p>
        Unlike class expressions, aspects are not instantiated with
        <tt>new</tt> expressions.  Rather, aspect instances are
        automatically created to cut across programs.  A program
          can get a reference to an aspect instance using the static
          method <tt>aspectOf(..)</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Because advice only runs in the context of an aspect instance, aspect
        instantiation indirectly controls when advice runs.
      </p><p>
        The criteria used to determine how an aspect is instantiated
        is inherited from its parent aspect.  If the aspect has no parent
        aspect, then by default the aspect is a singleton aspect.
        How an aspect is instantiated controls the form of the 
        <tt>aspectOf(..)</tt> method defined on the
        concrete aspect class.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7088"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7088"></a>Singleton Aspects</h4></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7092"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> { ... }</tt></li><li><a name="d0e7098"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> issingleton() { ... }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          By default (or by using the modifier <tt>issingleton()</tt>)
          an aspect has exactly one instance that cuts across the entire
          program.  That instance is available at any time during program
          execution from the static method <tt>aspectOf()</tt>
          automatically defined on all concrete aspects
          -- so, in the above examples, <tt>A.aspectOf()</tt> will
          return A's instance.  This aspect instance is created as the aspect's
          classfile is loaded.
        </p><p>
          Because the an instance of the aspect exists at all join points in
          the running of a program (once its class is loaded), its advice will
          have a chance to run at all such join points.
        </p><p>
          (In actuality, one instance of the aspect A is made for each version
          of the aspect A, so there will be one instantiation for each time A
          is loaded by a different classloader.)
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7119"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7119"></a>Per-object aspects</h4></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7123"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> perthis(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>) { ... }</tt></li><li><a name="d0e7132"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> pertarget(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>) { ... }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          If an aspect A is defined
          <tt>perthis(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>)</tt>, then
          one object of type A is created for every object that is the
          executing object (i.e., "this") at any of the join points picked out
          by <i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>.
          The advice defined in A will run only at a join point where the
          currently executing object has been associated with an instance of
          A.
        </p><p> Similarly, if an aspect A is defined
          <tt>pertarget(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>)</tt>,
          then one object of type A is created for every object that is the
          target object of the join points picked out by
          <i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>.
          The advice defined in A will run only at a join point where the
          target object has been associated with an instance of 
		  A.
        </p><p>
          In either case, the static method call
          <tt>A.aspectOf(Object)</tt> can be used to get the aspect
          instance (of type A) registered with the object.  Each aspect
          instance is created as early as possible, but not before reaching a
          join point picked out by <i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i> where
          there is no associated aspect of type A.
        </p><p> Both <tt>perthis</tt> and <tt>pertarget</tt>
        aspects may be affected by code the AspectJ compiler controls, as
        discussed in the <a href="implementation.html">Implementation Notes</a> appendix.  </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7181"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7181"></a>Per-control-flow aspects</h4></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7185"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> percflow(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>) { ... }</tt></li><li><a name="d0e7194"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> percflowbelow(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>) { ... }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          If an aspect A is defined
          <tt>percflow(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>)</tt> or
          <tt>percflowbelow(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>)</tt>,
          then one object of type A is created for each flow of control of the
          join points picked out by <i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>, either
          as the flow of control is entered, or below the flow of control,
          respectively.  The advice defined in A may run at any join point in
          or under that control flow.  During each such flow of control, the
          static method <tt>A.aspectOf()</tt> will return an object
          of type
          A. An instance of the aspect is created upon entry into each such
          control flow.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7223"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7223"></a>Aspect instantiation and advice</h4></div></div><p>
          All advice runs in the context of an aspect instance,
          but it is possible to write a piece of advice with a pointcut
          that picks out a join point that must occur before asopect
          instantiation.  For example:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  public class Client
  {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Client c = new Client();
      }
  }

  aspect Watchcall {
      pointcut myConstructor(): execution(new(..));

      before(): myConstructor() {
          System.err.println("Entering Constructor");
      }
  }
</pre><p>
          The before advice should run before the execution of all
          constructors in the system. It must run in the context of an
          instance of the Watchcall aspect. The only way to get such an
          instance is to have Watchcall's default constructor execute. But
          before that executes, we need to run the before advice...
        </p><p>
          There is no general way to detect these kinds of circularities at
          compile time.  If advice runs before its aspect is instantiated,
          AspectJ will throw a <a href="../api/org/aspectj/lang/NoAspectBoundException.html" target="_top">
          <tt>org.aspectj.lang.NoAspectBoundException</tt></a>.
        </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="aspect-privilege"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aspect-privilege"></a>Aspect privilege</h3></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7243"></a><tt>privileged aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> { ... }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
        Code written in aspects is subject to the same access control rules as
        Java code when referring to members of classes or aspects. So, for
        example, code written in an aspect may not refer to members with
        default (package-protected) visibility unless the aspect is defined in
        the same package.
      </p><p>
        While these restrictions are suitable for many aspects, there may be
        some aspects in which advice or inter-type members needs to access private
        or protected resources of other types. To allow this, aspects may be
        declared <tt>privileged</tt>.  Code in priviliged aspects has
        access to all members, even private ones.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class C {
      private int i = 0;
      void incI(int x) { i = i+x; }
  }
  privileged aspect A {
      static final int MAX = 1000;
      before(int x, C c): call(void C.incI(int)) &amp;&amp; target(c) &amp;&amp; args(x) {
	  if (c.i+x &gt; MAX) throw new RuntimeException();
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        In this case, if A had not been declared privileged, the field reference
        c.i would have resulted in an error signaled by the compiler.
      </p><p>
        If a privileged aspect can access multiple versions of a particular
        member, then those that it could see if it were not privileged take
        precedence. For example, in the code
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class C {
      private int i = 0;
      void foo() { }
  }
  privileged aspect A {
      private int C.i = 999;
      before(C c): call(void C.foo()) target(c) {
	  System.out.println(c.i);
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        A's private inter-type field C.i, initially bound to 999, will be
        referenced in the body of the advice in preference to C's privately
        declared field, since the A would have access to its own inter-type
        fields even if it were not privileged.
      </p><p>
        Note that a privileged aspect can access private inter-type
        declarations made by other aspects, since they are simply
        considered private members of that other aspect.
