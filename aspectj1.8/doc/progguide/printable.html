      </p><p>
        If you are completely new to AspectJ, you should first read
        <a href="#starting">Getting Started with AspectJ</a> for a broad overview of programming
        in AspectJ. If you are already familiar with AspectJ, but want a deeper
        understanding, you should read <a href="#language">The AspectJ Language</a> and
        look at the examples in the chapter. If you want a more formal
        definition of AspectJ, you should read <a href="#semantics">Semantics</a>.

    This programming guide does three things. It

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul compact><li><p><a name="d0e32"></a>introduces the AspectJ language</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e35"></a>
          defines each of AspectJ's constructs and their semantics, and
        </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e38"></a>
          provides examples of their use.
        </p></li></ul></div>

    It includes appendices that give a reference to the syntax of AspectJ,
    a more formal description of AspectJ's semantics, and a description of
    notes about the AspectJ implementation.
  </p><p>
    The first section, <a href="#starting">Getting Started with AspectJ</a>, provides a gentle
    overview of writing AspectJ programs. It also shows how one can
    introduce AspectJ into an existing development effort in stages,
    reducing the associated risk. You should read this section if this is
    your first exposure to AspectJ and you want to get a sense of what
    AspectJ is all about.
  </p><p>
    The second section, <a href="#language">The AspectJ Language</a>, covers the features of
    the language in more detail, using code snippets as examples.  All the
    basics of the language is covered, and after reading this section, you
    should be able to use the language correctly.
  </p><p>
    The next section, <a href="#examples">Examples</a>, comprises a set of
    complete programs that not only show the features being used, but also
    try to illustrate recommended practice. You should read this section
    after you are familiar with the elements of AspectJ.
  </p><p>
    Finally, there are two short chapters, one on <a href="#idioms">Idioms</a>
    and one on <a href="#pitfalls">Pitfalls</a>.
  </p><p>
    The back matter contains several appendices that cover a <a href="#quick">AspectJ Quick Reference</a> to the language's syntax, a more
    in depth coverage of its <a href="#semantics">Semantics</a>,
    and a description of the latitude enjoyed by its <a href="#implementation">Implementation Notes</a>.

      Many software developers are attracted to the idea of aspect-oriented
      programming (AOP) but unsure about how to begin using the
      technology. They recognize the concept of crosscutting concerns, and
      know that they have had problems with the implementation of such
      concerns in the past. But there are many questions about how to adopt
      AOP into the development process. Common questions include:

      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul compact><li><p><a name="d0e80"></a>Can I use aspects in my existing code?</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e83"></a>
            What kinds of benefits can I expect to get from using aspects?
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e86"></a>How do I find aspects in my programs?</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e89"></a>How steep is the learning curve for AOP?</p></li><li><p><a name="d0e92"></a>What are the risks of using this new technology?</p></li></ul></div>
    </p><p>
      This chapter addresses these questions in the context of AspectJ: a
      general-purpose aspect-oriented extension to Java. A series of
      abridged examples illustrate the kinds of aspects programmers may
      want to implement using AspectJ and the benefits associated with
      doing so.  Readers who would like to understand the examples in more
      detail, or who want to learn how to program examples like these, can
      find more complete examples and supporting material linked from the
      AspectJ web site ( <a href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj" target="_top">http://eclipse.org/aspectj</a> ).
    </p><p>
      A significant risk in adopting any new technology is going too far
      too fast. Concern about this risk causes many organizations to be
      conservative about adopting new technology. To address this issue,
      the examples in this chapter are grouped into three broad categories,
      with aspects that are easier to adopt into existing development
      projects coming earlier in this chapter. The next section, <a href="#starting-aspectj">Introduction to AspectJ</a>, we present the core of AspectJ's
      features, and in <a href="#starting-development">Development Aspects</a>, we present
      aspects that facilitate tasks such as debugging, testing and
      performance tuning of applications. And, in the section following,
      <a href="#starting-production">Production Aspects</a>, we present aspects that
      implement crosscutting functionality common in Java applications. We
      will defer discussing a third category of aspects, reusable aspects,
      until <a href="#language">The AspectJ Language</a>.
    </p><p>
      These categories are informal, and this ordering is not the only way
      to adopt AspectJ. Some developers may want to use a production aspect
      right away. But our experience with current AspectJ users suggests
      that this is one ordering that allows developers to get experience
      with (and benefit from) AOP technology quickly, while also minimizing
      risk.
    </p></div><div class="sect1"><a name="starting-aspectj"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="starting-aspectj"></a>Introduction to AspectJ</h2></div></div><p>
      This section presents a brief introduction to the features of AspectJ
      used later in this chapter. These features are at the core of the
      language, but this is by no means a complete overview of AspectJ.
    </p><p>
      The features are presented using a simple figure editor system. A
      <tt>Figure</tt> consists of a number of
      <tt>FigureElements</tt>, which can be either
      <tt>Point</tt>s or <tt>Line</tt>s. The
      <tt>Figure</tt> class provides factory services. There
      is also a <tt>Display</tt>. Most example programs later
      in this chapter are based on this system as well.
    </p><p>
      <div class="mediaobject"><img src="figureUML.gif"><div class="caption"><p>
            UML for the <tt>FigureEditor</tt> example
          </p></div></div>
    </p><p>
      The motivation for AspectJ (and likewise for aspect-oriented
      programming) is the realization that there are issues or concerns
      that are not well captured by traditional programming
      methodologies. Consider the problem of enforcing a security policy in
      some application. By its nature, security cuts across many of the
      natural units of modularity of the application. Moreover, the
      security policy must be uniformly applied to any additions as the
      application evolves. And the security policy that is being applied
      might itself evolve. Capturing concerns like a security policy in a
      disciplined way is difficult and error-prone in a traditional
      programming language.
    </p><p>
      Concerns like security cut across the natural units of
      modularity. For object-oriented programming languages, the natural
      unit of modularity is the class. But in object-oriented programming
      languages, crosscutting concerns are not easily turned into classes
      precisely because they cut across classes, and so these aren't
      reusable, they can't be refined or inherited, they are spread through
      out the program in an undisciplined way, in short, they are difficult
      to work with.
    </p><p>
      Aspect-oriented programming is a way of modularizing crosscutting
      concerns much like object-oriented programming is a way of
      modularizing common concerns. AspectJ is an implementation of
      aspect-oriented programming for Java.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ adds to Java just one new concept, a join point -- and that's
      really just a name for an existing Java concept.  It adds to Java
      only a few new constructs: pointcuts, advice, inter-type declarations
      and aspects.  Pointcuts and advice dynamically affect program flow,
      inter-type declarations statically affects a program's class
      hierarchy, and aspects encapsulate these new constructs.
    </p><p>
      A <span class="emphasis"><i>join point</i></span> is a well-defined point in the
      program flow.  A <span class="emphasis"><i>pointcut</i></span> picks out certain join
      points and values at those points.  A piece of
      <span class="emphasis"><i>advice</i></span> is code that is executed when a join
      point is reached. These are the dynamic parts of AspectJ.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ also has different kinds of <span class="emphasis"><i>inter-type
      declarations</i></span> that allow the programmer to modify a
      program's static structure, namely, the members of its classes and
      the relationship between classes.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ's <span class="emphasis"><i>aspect</i></span> are the unit of modularity for
      crosscutting concerns.  They behave somewhat like Java classes, but
      may also include pointcuts, advice and inter-type declarations.
    </p><p>
      In the sections immediately following, we are first going to look at
      join points and how they compose into pointcuts. Then we will look at
      advice, the code which is run when a pointcut is reached. We will see
      how to combine pointcuts and advice into aspects, AspectJ's reusable,
      inheritable unit of modularity. Lastly, we will look at how to use
      inter-type declarations to deal with crosscutting concerns of a
      program's class structure.
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="the-dynamic-join-point-model"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="the-dynamic-join-point-model"></a>The Dynamic Join Point Model</h3></div></div><p>
        A critical element in the design of any aspect-oriented language is
        the join point model. The join point model provides the common
        frame of reference that makes it possible to define the dynamic
        structure of crosscutting concerns.  This chapter describes
        AspectJ's dynamic join points, in which join points are certain
        well-defined points in the execution of the program.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ provides for many kinds of join points, but this chapter
        discusses only one of them: method call join points. A method call
        join point encompasses the actions of an object receiving a method
        call. It includes all the actions that comprise a method call,
        starting after all arguments are evaluated up to and including
        return (either normally or by throwing an exception).
      </p><p>
        Each method call at runtime is a different join point, even if it
        comes from the same call expression in the program.  Many other
        join points may run while a method call join point is executing --
        all the join points that happen while executing the method body,
        and in those methods called from the body.  We say that these join
        points execute in the <span class="emphasis"><i>dynamic context</i></span> of the
        original call join point.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pointcuts"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcuts"></a>Pointcuts</h3></div></div><p>
        In AspectJ, <span class="emphasis"><i>pointcuts</i></span> pick out certain join
        points in the program flow. For example, the pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void Point.setX(int))
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that is a call to a method that has the
        signature <tt>void Point.setX(int)</tt> &#8212; that is,
        <tt>Point</tt>'s void <tt>setX</tt>
        method with a single <tt>int</tt> parameter.
      </p><p>
        A pointcut can be built out of other pointcuts with and, or, and
        not (spelled <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, <tt>||</tt>,
        and <tt>!</tt>).  For example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void Point.setX(int)) ||
call(void Point.setY(int))
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that is either a call to
        <tt>setX</tt> or a call to <tt>setY</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Pointcuts can identify join points from many different types
        &#8212; in other words, they can crosscut types.  For example,
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void FigureElement.setXY(int,int)) ||
call(void Point.setX(int))              ||
call(void Point.setY(int))              ||
call(void Line.setP1(Point))            ||
call(void Line.setP2(Point));
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that is a call to one of five methods
        (the first of which is an interface method, by the way).
      </p><p>
        In our example system, this pointcut captures all the join points
        when a <tt>FigureElement</tt> moves.  While this is a
        useful way to specify this crosscutting concern, it is a bit of a
        mouthful.  So AspectJ allows programmers to define their own named
        pointcuts with the <tt>pointcut</tt> form.  So the
        following declares a new, named pointcut:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut move():
    call(void FigureElement.setXY(int,int)) ||
    call(void Point.setX(int))              ||
    call(void Point.setY(int))              ||
    call(void Line.setP1(Point))            ||
    call(void Line.setP2(Point));
</pre><p>
        and whenever this definition is visible, the programmer can simply
        use <tt>move()</tt> to capture this complicated
        pointcut.
      </p><p>
        The previous pointcuts are all based on explicit enumeration of a
        set of method signatures. We sometimes call this
        <span class="emphasis"><i>name-based</i></span> crosscutting. AspectJ also
        provides mechanisms that enable specifying a pointcut in terms of
        properties of methods other than their exact name. We call this
        <span class="emphasis"><i>property-based</i></span> crosscutting. The simplest of
        these involve using wildcards in certain fields of the method
        signature. For example, the pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void Figure.make*(..))
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that's a call to a void method defined
        on <tt>Figure</tt> whose the name begins with
        "<tt>make</tt>" regardless of the method's parameters.
        In our system, this picks out calls to the factory methods
        <tt>makePoint</tt> and <tt>makeLine</tt>.
        The pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(public * Figure.* (..))
</pre><p>
        picks out each call to <tt>Figure</tt>'s public
        methods.
      </p><p>
        But wildcards aren't the only properties AspectJ supports.
        Another pointcut, <tt>cflow</tt>, identifies join
        points based on whether they occur in the dynamic context of
        other join points.  So
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
cflow(move())
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that occurs in the dynamic context of
        the join points picked out by <tt>move()</tt>, our named
        pointcut defined above.  So this picks out each join points that
        occurrs between when a move method is called and when it returns
        (either normally or by throwing an exception).
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="advice"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="advice"></a>Advice</h3></div></div><p>
        So pointcuts pick out join points.  But they don't
        <span class="emphasis"><i>do</i></span> anything apart from picking out join
        points.  To actually implement crosscutting behavior, we use
        advice.  Advice brings together a pointcut (to pick out join
        points) and a body of code (to run at each of those join points).
      </p><p>
        AspectJ has several different kinds of advice. <span class="emphasis"><i>Before
        advice</i></span> runs as a join point is reached, before the
        program proceeds with the join point.  For example, before advice
        on a method call join point runs before the actual method starts
        running, just after the arguments to the method call are evaluated.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
before(): move() {
    System.out.println("about to move");
}
</pre><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>After advice</i></span> on a particular join point runs
        after the program proceeds with that join point.  For example,
        after advice on a method call join point runs after the method body
        has run, just before before control is returned to the caller.
        Because Java programs can leave a join point 'normally' or by
        throwing an exception, there are three kinds of after advice:
        <tt>after returning</tt>, <tt>after
        throwing</tt>, and plain <tt>after</tt> (which runs
        after returning <span class="emphasis"><i>or</i></span> throwing, like Java's
        <tt>finally</tt>).
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
after() returning: move() {
    System.out.println("just successfully moved");
}
</pre><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>Around advice</i></span> on a join point runs as the join
        point is reached, and has explicit control over whether the program
        proceeds with the join point.  Around advice is not discussed in
        this section.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e346"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e346"></a>Exposing Context in Pointcuts</h4></div></div><p>
          Pointcuts not only pick out join points, they can also expose
          part of the execution context at their join points. Values
          exposed by a pointcut can be used in the body of advice
          declarations.
        </p><p>
          An advice declaration has a parameter list (like a method) that
          gives names to all the pieces of context that it uses.  For
          example, the after advice
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning:
        ...SomePointcut... {
    ...SomeBody...
}
</pre><p>
           uses three pieces of exposed context, a
           <tt>FigureElement</tt> named fe, and two
           <tt>int</tt>s named x and y.
         </p><p>
          The body of the advice uses the names just like method
          parameters, so
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning:
        ...SomePointcut... {
    System.out.println(fe + " moved to (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
}
</pre><p>
          The advice's pointcut publishes the values for the advice's
          arguments.  The three primitive pointcuts
          <tt>this</tt>, <tt>target</tt> and
          <tt>args</tt> are used to publish these values.  So now
          we can write the complete piece of advice:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning:
        call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int))
        &amp;&amp; target(fe)
        &amp;&amp; args(x, y) {
    System.out.println(fe + " moved to (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
}
</pre><p>
          The pointcut exposes three values from calls to
          <tt>setXY</tt>: the target
          <tt>FigureElement</tt> -- which it publishes as
          <tt>fe</tt>, so it becomes the first argument to the
          after advice -- and the two int arguments -- which it publishes
          as <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, so they become
          the second and third argument to the after advice.
        </p><p>
          So the advice prints the figure element
          that was moved and its new <tt>x</tt> and
          <tt>y</tt> coordinates after each
          <tt>setXY</tt> method call.
        </p><p>
          A named pointcut may have parameters like a piece of advice.
          When the named pointcut is used (by advice, or in another named
          pointcut), it publishes its context by name just like the
          <tt>this</tt>, <tt>target</tt> and
          <tt>args</tt> pointcut.  So another way to write the
          above advice is
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut setXY(FigureElement fe, int x, int y):
    call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int))
    &amp;&amp; target(fe)
    &amp;&amp; args(x, y);

after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning: setXY(fe, x, y) {
    System.out.println(fe + " moved to (" + x + ", " + y + ").");
}
</pre></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="inter-type-declarations"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inter-type-declarations"></a>Inter-type declarations</h3></div></div><p>
        Inter-type declarations in AspectJ are declarations that cut across
        classes and their hierarchies.  They may declare members that cut
        across multiple classes, or change the inheritance relationship
        between classes.  Unlike advice, which operates primarily
        dynamically, introduction operates statically, at compile-time.
      </p><p>
        Consider the problem of expressing a capability shared by some
        existing classes that are already part of a class hierarchy,
        i.e. they already extend a class.  In Java, one creates an
        interface that captures this new capability, and then adds to
        <span class="emphasis"><i>each affected class</i></span> a method that implements
        this interface.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ can express the concern in one place, by using inter-type
        declarations.  The aspect declares the methods and fields that are
        necessary to implement the new capability, and associates the
        methods and fields to the existing classes.
      </p><p>
        Suppose we want to have <tt>Screen</tt> objects
        observe changes to <tt>Point</tt> objects, where
        <tt>Point</tt> is an existing class. We can implement
        this by writing an aspect declaring that the class Point
        <tt>Point</tt> has an instance field,
        <tt>observers</tt>, that keeps track of the
        <tt>Screen</tt> objects that are observing
        <tt>Point</tt>s.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointObserving {
    private Vector Point.observers = new Vector();
    ...
}
</pre><p>
        The <tt>observers</tt> field is private, so only
        <tt>PointObserving</tt> can see it.  So observers are
        added or removed with the static methods
        <tt>addObserver</tt> and
        <tt>removeObserver</tt> on the aspect.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointObserving {
    private Vector Point.observers = new Vector();

    public static void addObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.add(s);
    }
    public static void removeObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.remove(s);
    }
    ...
}
</pre><p>
        Along with this, we can define a pointcut
        <tt>changes</tt> that defines what we want to observe,
        and the after advice defines what we want to do when we observe a
        change.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointObserving {
    private Vector Point.observers = new Vector();

    public static void addObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.add(s);
    }
    public static void removeObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.remove(s);
    }

    pointcut changes(Point p): target(p) &amp;&amp; call(void Point.set*(int));

    after(Point p): changes(p) {
        Iterator iter = p.observers.iterator();
        while ( iter.hasNext() ) {
            updateObserver(p, (Screen)iter.next());
        }
    }

    static void updateObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        s.display(p);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        Note that neither <tt>Screen</tt>'s nor
        <tt>Point</tt>'s code has to be modified, and that
        all the changes needed to support this new capability are local to
        this aspect.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="aspects"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aspects"></a>Aspects</h3></div></div><p>
        Aspects wrap up pointcuts, advice, and inter-type declarations in a
        a modular unit of crosscutting implementation.  It is defined very
        much like a class, and can have methods, fields, and initializers
        in addition to the crosscutting members.  Because only aspects may
        include these crosscutting members, the declaration of these
        effects is localized.
      </p><p>
        Like classes, aspects may be instantiated, but AspectJ controls how
        that instantiation happens -- so you can't use Java's
        <tt>new</tt> form to build new aspect instances.  By
        default, each aspect is a singleton, so one aspect instance is
        created.  This means that advice may use non-static fields of the
        aspect, if it needs to keep state around:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect Logging {
    OutputStream logStream = System.err;

    before(): move() {
        logStream.println("about to move");
    }
}
</pre><p>
        Aspects may also have more complicated rules for instantiation, but
        these will be described in a later chapter.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><a name="starting-development"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="starting-development"></a>Development Aspects</h2></div></div><p>
      The next two sections present the use of aspects in increasingly
      sophisticated ways. Development aspects are easily removed from
      production builds. Production aspects are intended to be used in
      both development and in production, but tend to affect only a few
      classes.
    </p><p>
      This section presents examples of aspects that can be used during
      development of Java applications. These aspects facilitate debugging,
      testing and performance tuning work. The aspects define behavior that
      ranges from simple tracing, to profiling, to testing of internal
      consistency within the application. Using AspectJ makes it possible
      to cleanly modularize this kind of functionality, thereby making it
      possible to easily enable and disable the functionality when desired.
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="tracing"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tracing"></a>Tracing</h3></div></div><p>
        This first example shows how to increase the visibility of the
        internal workings of a program. It is a simple tracing aspect that
        prints a message at specified method calls. In our figure editor
        example, one such aspect might simply trace whenever points are
        drawn.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect SimpleTracing {
    pointcut tracedCall():
        call(void FigureElement.draw(GraphicsContext));

    before(): tracedCall() {
        System.out.println("Entering: " + thisJoinPoint);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        This code makes use of the <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> special
        variable. Within all advice bodies this variable is bound to an
        object that describes the current join point. The effect of this
        code is to print a line like the following every time a figure
        element receives a <tt>draw</tt> method call:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
Entering: call(void FigureElement.draw(GraphicsContext))
</pre><p>
        To understand the benefit of coding this with AspectJ consider
        changing the set of method calls that are traced. With AspectJ,
        this just requires editing the definition of the
        <tt>tracedCalls</tt> pointcut and recompiling. The
        individual methods that are traced do not need to be edited.
      </p><p>
        When debugging, programmers often invest considerable effort in
        figuring out a good set of trace points to use when looking for a
        particular kind of problem. When debugging is complete or appears
        to be complete it is frustrating to have to lose that investment by
        deleting trace statements from the code. The alternative of just
        commenting them out makes the code look bad, and can cause trace
        statements for one kind of debugging to get confused with trace
        statements for another kind of debugging.
      </p><p>
        With AspectJ it is easy to both preserve the work of designing a
        good set of trace points and disable the tracing when it isn t
        being used. This is done by writing an aspect specifically for that
        tracing mode, and removing that aspect from the compilation when it
        is not needed.
      </p><p>
        This ability to concisely implement and reuse debugging
        configurations that have proven useful in the past is a direct
        result of AspectJ modularizing a crosscutting design element the
        set of methods that are appropriate to trace when looking for a
        given kind of information.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="profiling-and-logging"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="profiling-and-logging"></a>Profiling and Logging</h3></div></div><p>
        Our second example shows you how to do some very specific
        profiling. Although many sophisticated profiling tools are
        available, and these can gather a variety of information and
        display the results in useful ways, you may sometimes want to
        profile or log some very specific behavior. In these cases, it is
        often possible to write a simple aspect similar to the ones above
        to do the job.
      </p><p>
        For example, the following aspect counts the number of calls to the
        <tt>rotate</tt> method on a <tt>Line</tt>
        and the number of calls to the <tt>set*</tt> methods of
        a <tt>Point</tt> that happen within the control flow
        of those calls to <tt>rotate</tt>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect SetsInRotateCounting {
    int rotateCount = 0;
    int setCount = 0;

    before(): call(void Line.rotate(double)) {
        rotateCount++;
    }

    before(): call(void Point.set*(int))
              &amp;&amp; cflow(call(void Line.rotate(double))) {
        setCount++;
    }
}
</pre><p>
        In effect, this aspect allows the programmer to ask very specific
        questions like

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          How many times is the <tt>rotate</tt>
          method defined on <tt>Line</tt> objects called?
        </blockquote>

        and

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          How many times are methods defined on
          <tt>Point</tt> objects whose name begins with
          "<tt>set</tt>" called in fulfilling those rotate
          calls?
        </blockquote>

        questions it may be difficult to express using standard
        profiling or logging tools.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pre-and-post-conditions"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pre-and-post-conditions"></a>Pre- and Post-Conditions</h3></div></div><p>
        Many programmers use the "Design by Contract" style popularized by
        Bertand Meyer in <i>Object-Oriented Software Construction,
        2/e</i>. In this style of programming, explicit
        pre-conditions test that callers of a method call it properly and
        explicit post-conditions test that methods properly do the work
        they are supposed to.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ makes it possible to implement pre- and post-condition
        testing in modular form. For example, this code
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointBoundsChecking {

    pointcut setX(int x):
        (call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int)) &amp;&amp; args(x, *))
        || (call(void Point.setX(int)) &amp;&amp; args(x));

    pointcut setY(int y):
        (call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int)) &amp;&amp; args(*, y))
        || (call(void Point.setY(int)) &amp;&amp; args(y));

    before(int x): setX(x) {
        if ( x &lt; MIN_X || x &gt; MAX_X )
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("x is out of bounds.");
    }

    before(int y): setY(y) {
        if ( y &lt; MIN_Y || y &gt; MAX_Y )
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("y is out of bounds.");
    }
}
</pre><p>
        implements the bounds checking aspect of pre-condition testing for
        operations that move points. Notice that the
        <tt>setX</tt> pointcut refers to all the operations
        that can set a Point's <tt>x</tt> coordinate; this
        includes the <tt>setX</tt> method, as well as half of
        the <tt>setXY</tt> method. In this sense the
        <tt>setX</tt> pointcut can be seen as involving very
        fine-grained crosscutting &#8212; it names the the
        <tt>setX</tt> method and half of the
        <tt>setXY</tt> method.
      </p><p>
        Even though pre- and post-condition testing aspects can often be
        used only during testing, in some cases developers may wish to
        include them in the production build as well. Again, because
        AspectJ makes it possible to modularize these crosscutting concerns
        cleanly, it gives developers good control over this decision.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="contract-enforcement"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="contract-enforcement"></a>Contract Enforcement</h3></div></div><p>
        The property-based crosscutting mechanisms can be very useful in
        defining more sophisticated contract enforcement. One very powerful
        use of these mechanisms is to identify method calls that, in a
        correct program, should not exist. For example, the following
        aspect enforces the constraint that only the well-known factory
        methods can add an element to the registry of figure
        elements. Enforcing this constraint ensures that no figure element
        is added to the registry more than once.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect RegistrationProtection {

    pointcut register(): call(void Registry.register(FigureElement));

    pointcut canRegister(): withincode(static * FigureElement.make*(..));

    before(): register() &amp;&amp; !canRegister() {
        throw new IllegalAccessException("Illegal call " + thisJoinPoint);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        This aspect uses the withincode primitive pointcut to denote all
        join points that occur within the body of the factory methods on
        <tt>FigureElement</tt> (the methods with names that
        begin with "<tt>make</tt>"). This is a property-based
        pointcut because it identifies join points based not on their
        signature, but rather on the property that they occur specifically
        within the code of another method. The before advice declaration
        effectively says signal an error for any calls to register that are
        not within the factory methods.
      </p><p>
        This advice throws a runtime exception at certain join points, but
        AspectJ can do better.  Using the <tt>declare error</tt>
        form, we can have the <span class="emphasis"><i>compiler</i></span> signal the
        error.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect RegistrationProtection {

    pointcut register(): call(void Registry.register(FigureElement));
    pointcut canRegister(): withincode(static * FigureElement.make*(..));

    declare error: register() &amp;&amp; !canRegister(): "Illegal call"
}
</pre><p>
        When using this aspect, it is impossible for the compiler to
        compile programs with these illegal calls.  This early detection is
        not always possible.  In this case, since we depend only on static
        information (the <tt>withincode</tt> pointcut picks out
        join points totally based on their code, and the
        <tt>call</tt> pointcut here picks out join points
        statically).  Other enforcement, such as the precondition
        enforcement, above, does require dynamic information such as the
        runtime value of parameters.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="configuration-management"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="configuration-management"></a>Configuration Management</h3></div></div><p>
        Configuration management for aspects can be handled using a variety
        of make-file like techniques. To work with optional aspects, the
        programmer can simply define their make files to either include the
        aspect in the call to the AspectJ compiler or not, as desired.
      </p><p>
        Developers who want to be certain that no aspects are included in
        the production build can do so by configuring their make files so
        that they use a traditional Java compiler for production builds. To
        make it easy to write such make files, the AspectJ compiler has a
        command-line interface that is consistent with ordinary Java
        compilers.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><a name="starting-production"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="starting-production"></a>Production Aspects</h2></div></div><p>
        This section presents examples of aspects that are inherently
        intended to be included in the production builds of an application.
        Production aspects tend to add functionality to an application
        rather than merely adding more visibility of the internals of a
        program. Again, we begin with name-based aspects and follow with
        property-based aspects.  Name-based production aspects tend to
        affect only a small number of methods. For this reason, they are a
        good next step for projects adopting AspectJ. But even though they
        tend to be small and simple, they can often have a significant
        effect in terms of making the program easier to understand and
        maintain.

        The first example production aspect shows how one might implement
        some simple functionality where it is problematic to try and do it
        explicitly. It supports the code that refreshes the display. The
        role of the aspect is to maintain a dirty bit indicating whether or
        not an object has moved since the last time the display was
        refreshed.
      </p><p>
        Implementing this functionality as an aspect is straightforward.
        The <tt>testAndClear</tt> method is called by the
        display code to find out whether a figure element has moved
        recently. This method returns the current state of the dirty flag
        and resets it to false. The pointcut <tt>move</tt>
        captures all the method calls that can move a figure element. The
        after advice on <tt>move</tt> sets the dirty flag
        whenever an object moves.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect MoveTracking {
    private static boolean dirty = false;

    public static boolean testAndClear() {
        boolean result = dirty;
        dirty = false;
        return result;
    }

    pointcut move():
        call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int)) ||
        call(void Line.setP1(Point))             ||
        call(void Line.setP2(Point))             ||
        call(void Point.setX(int))               ||
        call(void Point.setY(int));

    after() returning: move() {
        dirty = true;
    }
}
</pre><p>
        Even this simple example serves to illustrate some of the important
        benefits of using AspectJ in production code. Consider implementing
        this functionality with ordinary Java: there would likely be a
        helper class that contained the <tt>dirty</tt> flag, the
        <tt>testAndClear</tt> method, as well as a
        <tt>setFlag</tt> method. Each of the methods that could
        move a figure element would include a call to the
        <tt>setFlag</tt> method. Those calls, or rather the
        concept that those calls should happen at each move operation, are
        the crosscutting concern in this case.
      </p><p>
        The AspectJ implementation has several advantages over the standard
        implementation:
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>The structure of the crosscutting concern is captured
        explicitly.</i></span> The moves pointcut clearly states all the
        methods involved, so the programmer reading the code sees not just
        individual calls to <tt>setFlag</tt>, but instead sees
        the real structure of the code. The IDE support included with
        AspectJ automatically reminds the programmer that this aspect
        advises each of the methods involved.  The IDE support also
        provides commands to jump to the advice from the method and
        vice-versa.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>Evolution is easier.</i></span> If, for example, the
        aspect needs to be revised to record not just that some figure
        element moved, but rather to record exactly which figure elements
        moved, the change would be entirely local to the aspect. The
        pointcut would be updated to expose the object being moved, and the
        advice would be updated to record that object. The paper
        <i>An Overview of AspectJ</i> (available linked off
        of the AspectJ web site -- <a href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj" target="_top">http://eclipse.org/aspectj</a>), presented at ECOOP
        2001, presents a detailed discussion of various ways this aspect
        could be expected to evolve.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>The functionality is easy to plug in and out.</i></span>
        Just as with development aspects, production aspects may need to be
        removed from the system, either because the functionality is no
        longer needed at all, or because it is not needed in certain
        configurations of a system. Because the functionality is
        modularized in a single aspect this is easy to do.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>The implementation is more stable.</i></span> If, for
        example, the programmer adds a subclass of
        <tt>Line</tt> that overrides the existing methods,
        this advice in this aspect will still apply. In the ordinary Java
        implementation the programmer would have to remember to add the
        call to <tt>setFlag</tt> in the new overriding
        method. This benefit is often even more compelling for
        property-based aspects (see the section <a href="#starting-production-consistentBehavior">Providing Consistent Behavior</a>).
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="context-passing"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="context-passing"></a>Context Passing</h3></div></div><p>
        The crosscutting structure of context passing can be a significant
        source of complexity in Java programs. Consider implementing
        functionality that would allow a client of the figure editor (a
        program client rather than a human) to set the color of any figure
        elements that are created. Typically this requires passing a color,
        or a color factory, from the client, down through the calls that
        lead to the figure element factory. All programmers are familiar
        with the inconvenience of adding a first argument to a number of
        methods just to pass this kind of context information.
      </p><p>
        Using AspectJ, this kind of context passing can be implemented in a
        modular way. The following code adds after advice that runs only
        when the factory methods of <tt>Figure</tt> are
        called in the control flow of a method on a
        <tt>ColorControllingClient</tt>.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect ColorControl {
    pointcut CCClientCflow(ColorControllingClient client):
        cflow(call(* * (..)) &amp;&amp; target(client));

    pointcut make(): call(FigureElement Figure.make*(..));

    after (ColorControllingClient c) returning (FigureElement fe):
            make() &amp;&amp; CCClientCflow(c) {
        fe.setColor(c.colorFor(fe));
    }
}
</pre><p>
        This aspect affects only a small number of methods, but note that
        the non-AOP implementation of this functionality might require
        editing many more methods, specifically, all the methods in the
        control flow from the client to the factory. This is a benefit
        common to many property-based aspects while the aspect is short and
        affects only a modest number of benefits, the complexity the aspect
        saves is potentially much larger.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="starting-production-consistentBehavior"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="starting-production-consistentBehavior"></a>Providing Consistent Behavior</h3></div></div><p>
        This example shows how a property-based aspect can be used to
        provide consistent handling of functionality across a large set of
        operations. This aspect ensures that all public methods of the
        <tt>com.bigboxco</tt> package log any Errors they throw
        to their caller (in Java, an Error is like an Exception, but it
        indicates that something really bad and usually unrecoverable has
        happened).  The <tt>publicMethodCall</tt> pointcut
        captures the public method calls of the package, and the after
        advice runs whenever one of those calls throws an Error. The advice
        logs that Error and then the throw resumes.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PublicErrorLogging {
    Log log = new Log();

    pointcut publicMethodCall():
        call(public * com.bigboxco.*.*(..));

    after() throwing (Error e): publicMethodCall() {
        log.write(e);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        In some cases this aspect can log an exception twice. This happens
        if code inside the <tt>com.bigboxco</tt> package itself
        calls a public method of the package. In that case this code will
        log the error at both the outermost call into the
        <tt>com.bigboxco</tt> package and the re-entrant
        call. The <tt>cflow</tt> primitive pointcut can be used
        in a nice way to exclude these re-entrant calls:</p><pre class="programlisting">
after() throwing (Error e):
        publicMethodCall() &amp;&amp; !cflow(publicMethodCall()) {
    log.write(e);
}
</pre><p>
        The following aspect is taken from work on the AspectJ compiler.
        The aspect advises about 35 methods in the
        <tt>JavaParser</tt> class. The individual methods
        handle each of the different kinds of elements that must be
        parsed. They have names like <tt>parseMethodDec</tt>,
        <tt>parseThrows</tt>, and
        <tt>parseExpr</tt>.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect ContextFilling {
    pointcut parse(JavaParser jp):
        call(* JavaParser.parse*(..))
        &amp;&amp; target(jp)
        &amp;&amp; !call(Stmt parseVarDec(boolean)); // var decs
                                              // are tricky

    around(JavaParser jp) returns ASTObject: parse(jp) {
        Token beginToken = jp.peekToken();
        ASTObject ret = proceed(jp);
        if (ret != null) jp.addContext(ret, beginToken);
        return ret;
     }
}
</pre><p>
        This example exhibits a property found in many aspects with large
        property-based pointcuts. In addition to a general property based
        pattern <tt>call(* JavaParser.parse*(..))</tt> it
        includes an exception to the pattern <tt>!call(Stmt
        parseVarDec(boolean))</tt>. The exclusion of
        <tt>parseVarDec</tt> happens because the parsing of
        variable declarations in Java is too complex to fit with the clean
        pattern of the other <tt>parse*</tt> methods. Even with
        the explicit exclusion this aspect is a clear expression of a clean
        crosscutting modularity. Namely that all
        <tt>parse*</tt> methods that return
        <tt>ASTObjects</tt>, except for
        <tt>parseVarDec</tt> share a common behavior for
        establishing the parse context of their result.
      </p><p>
        The process of writing an aspect with a large property-based
        pointcut, and of developing the appropriate exceptions can clarify
        the structure of the system. This is especially true, as in this
        case, when refactoring existing code to use aspects. When we first
        looked at the code for this aspect, we were able to use the IDE
        support provided in AJDE for JBuilder to see what methods the
        aspect was advising compared to our manual coding. We quickly
        discovered that there were a dozen places where the aspect advice
        was in effect but we had not manually inserted the required
        functionality. Two of these were bugs in our prior non-AOP
        implementation of the parser. The other ten were needless
        performance optimizations. So, here, refactoring the code to
        express the crosscutting structure of the aspect explicitly made
        the code more concise and eliminated latent bugs.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><a name="starting-conclusion"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="starting-conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
      AspectJ is a simple and practical aspect-oriented extension to
      Java. With just a few new constructs, AspectJ provides support for
      modular implementation of a range of crosscutting concerns.
    </p><p>
      Adoption of AspectJ into an existing Java development project can be
      a straightforward and incremental task. One path is to begin by using
      only development aspects, going on to using production aspects and
      then reusable aspects after building up experience with
      AspectJ. Adoption can follow other paths as well. For example, some
      developers will benefit from using production aspects right
      away. Others may be able to write clean reusable aspects almost right
      away.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ enables both name-based and property based crosscutting.
      Aspects that use name-based crosscutting tend to affect a small
      number of other classes. But despite their small scale, they can
      often eliminate significant complexity compared to an ordinary Java
      implementation.  Aspects that use property-based crosscutting can
      have small or large scale.
    </p><p>
      Using AspectJ results in clean well-modularized implementations of
      crosscutting concerns. When written as an AspectJ aspect the
      structure of a crosscutting concern is explicit and easy to
      understand. Aspects are also highly modular, making it possible to
      develop plug-and-play implementations of crosscutting
      functionality.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ provides more functionality than was covered by this short
      introduction. The next chapter, <a href="#language">The AspectJ Language</a>,
      covers in detail more of the features of the AspectJ language. The
      following chapter, <a href="#examples">Examples</a>, then presents some
      carefully chosen examples that show you how AspectJ might be used. We
      recommend that you read the next two chapters carefully before
      deciding to adopt AspectJ into a project.

      The previous chapter, <a href="#starting">Getting Started with AspectJ</a>, was a brief
      overview of the AspectJ language. You should read this chapter to
      understand AspectJ's syntax and semantics. It covers the same
      material as the previous chapter, but more completely and in much
      more detail.
    </p><p>
      We will start out by looking at an example aspect that we'll build
      out of a pointcut, an introduction, and two pieces of advice. This
      example aspect will gives us something concrete to talk about.
    </p></div><div class="sect1"><a name="language-anatomy"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="language-anatomy"></a>The Anatomy of an Aspect</h2></div></div><p>
      This lesson explains the parts of AspectJ's aspects. By reading this
      lesson you will have an overview of what's in an aspect and you will
      be exposed to the new terminology introduced by AspectJ.
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="an-example-aspect"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="an-example-aspect"></a>An Example Aspect</h3></div></div><p>
        Here's an example of an aspect definition in AspectJ:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
 1 aspect FaultHandler {
 2
 3   private boolean Server.disabled = false;
 4
 5   private void reportFault() {
 6     System.out.println("Failure! Please fix it.");
 7   }
 8
 9   public static void fixServer(Server s) {
10     s.disabled = false;
11   }
12
13   pointcut services(Server s): target(s) &amp;&amp; call(public * *(..));
14
15   before(Server s): services(s) {
16     if (s.disabled) throw new DisabledException();
17   }
18
19   after(Server s) throwing (FaultException e): services(s) {
20     s.disabled = true;
21     reportFault();
22   }
23 }
</pre><p>
        The <tt>FaultHandler</tt> consists of one inter-type
        field on <tt>Server</tt> (line 03), two methods (lines
        05-07 and 09-11), one pointcut definition (line 13), and two pieces
        of advice (lines 15-17 and 19-22).
      </p><p>
        This covers the basics of what aspects can contain. In general,
        aspects consist of an association of other program entities,
        ordinary variables and methods, pointcut definitions, inter-type declarations,
        and advice, where advice may be before, after or around advice. The
        remainder of this lesson focuses on those crosscut-related
        constructs.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pointcuts"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcuts"></a>Pointcuts</h3></div></div><p>
        AspectJ's pointcut definitions give names to pointcuts.  Pointcuts
        themselves pick out join points, i.e. interesting points in the
        execution of a program. These join points can be method or
        constructor invocations and executions, the handling of exceptions,
        field assignments and accesses, etc. Take, for example, the
        pointcut definition in line 13:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut services(Server s): target(s) &amp;&amp; call(public * *(..))
</pre><p>
        This pointcut, named <tt>services</tt>, picks out those
        points in the execution of the program when
        <tt>Server</tt> objects have their public methods called.
        It also allows anyone using the <tt>services</tt>
        pointcut to access the <tt>Server</tt> object whose
        method is being called.
      </p><p>
        The idea behind this pointcut in the
        <tt>FaultHandler</tt> aspect is that
        fault-handling-related behavior must be triggered on the calls to
        public methods. For example, the server may be unable to proceed
        with the request because of some fault. The calls of those methods
        are, therefore, interesting events for this aspect, in the sense
        that certain fault-related things will happen when these events
        occur.
      </p><p>
        Part of the context in which the events occur is exposed by the
        formal parameters of the pointcut. In this case, that consists of
        objects of type <tt>Server</tt>.  That formal parameter
        is then being used on the right hand side of the declaration in
        order to identify which events the pointcut refers to. In this
        case, a pointcut picking out join points where a Server is the
        target of some operation (target(s)) is being composed
        (<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, meaning and) with a pointcut
        picking out call join points (call(...)). The calls are identified
        by signatures that can include wild cards. In this case, there are
        wild cards in the return type position (first *), in the name
        position (second *) and in the argument list position (..); the
        only concrete information is given by the qualifier
        <tt>public</tt>.
      </p><p>
         Pointcuts pick out arbitrarily large numbers of join points of a
         program. But they pick out only a small number of
         <span class="emphasis"><i>kinds</i></span> of join points. Those kinds of join
         points correspond to some of the most important concepts in
         Java. Here is an incomplete list: method call, method execution,
         exception handling, instantiation, constructor execution, and
         field access.  Each kind of join point can be picked out by its
         own specialized pointcut that you will learn about in other parts
         of this guide.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="advice"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="advice"></a>Advice</h3></div></div><p>
        A piece of advice brings together a pointcut and a body of code to
        define aspect implementation that runs at join points picked out by
        the pointcut. For example, the advice in lines 15-17 specifies that
        the following piece of code
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
{
  if (s.disabled) throw new DisabledException();
}
</pre><p>
        is executed when instances of the <tt>Server</tt> class
        have their public methods called, as specified by the pointcut
        <tt>services</tt>. More specifically, it runs when those
        calls are made, just before the corresponding methods are executed.
      </p><p>
        The advice in lines 19-22 defines another piece of implementation
        that is executed on the same pointcut:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
{
  s.disabled = true;
  reportFault();
}
</pre><p>
        But this second method executes after those operations throw
        exception of type <tt>FaultException</tt>.
      </p><p>
        There are two other variations of after advice: upon successful
        return and upon return, either successful or with an exception.
        There is also a third kind of advice called around. You will see
        those in other parts of this guide.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><a name="language-joinPoints"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="language-joinPoints"></a>Join Points and Pointcuts</h2></div></div><p>
      Consider the following Java class:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
class Point {
    private int x, y;

    Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }

    void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }
    void setY(int y) { this.y = y; }

    int getX() { return x; }
    int getY() { return y; }
}
</pre><p>
      In order to get an intuitive understanding of AspectJ's join points
      and pointcuts, let's go back to some of the basic principles of
      Java. Consider the following a method declaration in class Point:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }
</pre><p>
      This piece of program says that when method named
      <tt>setX</tt> with an <tt>int</tt> argument
      called on an object of type <tt>Point</tt>, then the method
      body <tt>{ this.x = x; }</tt> is executed. Similarly, the
      constructor of the class states that when an object of type
      <tt>Point</tt> is instantiated through a constructor with
      two <tt>int</tt> arguments, then the constructor body
      <tt>{ this.x = x; this.y = y; }</tt> is executed.
    </p><p>
      One pattern that emerges from these descriptions is

      In object-oriented programs, there are several kinds of "things that
      happen" that are determined by the language. We call these the join
      points of Java. Join points consist of things like method calls,
      method executions, object instantiations, constructor executions,
      field references and handler executions. (See the <a href="#quick">AspectJ Quick Reference</a> for a complete listing.)
    </p><p>
      Pointcuts pick out these join points. For example, the pointcut
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut setter(): target(Point) &amp;&amp;
                   (call(void setX(int)) ||
                    call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
      picks out each call to <tt>setX(int)</tt> or
      <tt>setY(int)</tt> when called on an instance of
      <tt>Point</tt>.   Here's another example:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut ioHandler(): within(MyClass) &amp;&amp; handler(IOException);
</pre><p>
      This pointcut picks out each the join point when exceptions of type
      <tt>IOException</tt> are handled inside the code defined by
      class <tt>MyClass</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Pointcut definitions consist of a left-hand side and a right-hand side,
      separated by a colon. The left-hand side consists of the pointcut name
      and the pointcut parameters (i.e. the data available when the events
      happen).  The right-hand side consists of the pointcut itself.

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e1127"></a>
            It is possible to use wildcards. So

            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1131"></a>
                  <tt>execution(* *(..))</tt>

                  <tt>call(* set(..))</tt>
                </p></li></ol></div>

            means (1) the execution of any method regardless of return or
            parameter types, and (2) the call to any method named
            <tt>set</tt> regardless of return or parameter types
            -- in case of overloading there may be more than one such
            <tt>set</tt> method; this pointcut picks out calls to
            all of them.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1150"></a>
            You can select elements based on types. For example,
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1154"></a>

                </p></li></ol></div>

            means (1) the execution of any method with no parameters that
            returns an <tt>int</tt>, (2) the call to any
            <tt>setY</tt> method that takes a
            <tt>long</tt> as an argument, regardless of return
            type or declaring type, (3) the call to any of

            take an <tt>int</tt> as an argument, regardless of
            return type, and (4) the call to any classes' constructor, so
            long as it takes exactly two <tt>int</tt>s as
            arguments.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1200"></a>
            You can compose pointcuts. For example,
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1204"></a>
                  <tt>target(Point) &amp;&amp; call(int *())</tt>

            means (1) any call to an <tt>int</tt> method with no
            arguments on an instance of <tt>Point</tt>,
            regardless of its name, (2) any call to any method where the
            call is made from the code in <tt>Point</tt>'s or
            <tt>Line</tt>'s type declaration, (3) the execution of
            any constructor taking exactly one <tt>int</tt>
            argument, regardless of where the call is made from, and
            (4) any method call to an <tt>int</tt> method when
            the executing object is any type except <tt>Point</tt>.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1250"></a>
            You can select methods and constructors based on their
            modifiers and on negations of modifiers. For example, you can
            say:
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1254"></a>
                  <tt>call(public * *(..))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1260"></a>
                  <tt>execution(!static * *(..))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1266"></a>
                  <tt> execution(public !static * *(..))</tt>
                </p></li></ol></div>
            which means (1) any call to a public method, (2) any
            execution of a non-static method, and (3) any execution of a
            public, non-static method.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1273"></a>
            Pointcuts can also deal with interfaces. For example, given the
            interface </p><pre class="programlisting">
interface MyInterface { ... }
</pre><p>
            the pointcut <tt>call(* MyInterface.*(..))</tt> picks
            out any call to a method in <tt>MyInterface</tt>'s
            signature -- that is, any method defined by
            <tt>MyInterface</tt> or inherited by one of its a
            supertypes.
          </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="call-vs-execution"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="call-vs-execution"></a>call vs. execution</h3></div></div><p>
        When methods and constructors run, there are two interesting times
        associated with them.  That is when they are called, and when they
        actually execute.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ exposes these times as call and execution join points,
        respectively, and allows them to be picked out specifically by
        <tt>call</tt> and <tt>execution</tt> pointcuts.
      </p><p>
        So what's the difference between these join points?  Well, there are a
        number of differences:
      </p><p>
        Firstly, the lexical pointcut declarations
        <tt>within</tt> and <tt>withincode</tt> match
        differently.  At a call join point, the enclosing code is that of
        the call site.  This means that <tt>call(void m())
        &amp;&amp; withincode(void m())</tt> will only capture
        directly recursive calls, for example.  At an execution join point,
        however, the program is already executing the method, so the
        enclosing code is the method itself: <tt>execution(void m())
        &amp;&amp; withincode(void m())</tt> is the same as
        <tt>execution(void m())</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Secondly, the call join point does not capture super calls to
        non-static methods.  This is because such super calls are different in
        Java, since they don't behave via dynamic dispatch like other calls to
        non-static methods.
      </p><p>
        The rule of thumb is that if you want to pick a join point that
        runs when an actual piece of code runs (as is often the case for
        tracing), use <tt>execution</tt>, but if you want to pick
        one that runs when a particular <span class="emphasis"><i>signature</i></span> is
        called (as is often the case for production aspects), use
        <tt>call</tt>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pointcut-composition"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcut-composition"></a>Pointcut composition</h3></div></div><p>
        Pointcuts are put together with the operators and (spelled
        <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>), or (spelled <tt>||</tt>),
        and not (spelled <tt>!</tt>).  This allows the creation
        of very powerful pointcuts from the simple building blocks of
        primitive pointcuts.  This composition can be somewhat confusing
        when used with primitive pointcuts like <tt>cflow</tt>
        and <tt>cflowbelow</tt>.  Here's an example:
      </p><p>
        <tt>cflow(<i><tt>P</tt></i>)</tt> picks out
        each join point in the control flow of the join points picked out
        by <i><tt>P</tt></i>.  So, pictorially:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  P ---------------------
    \
     \  cflow of P
      \
</pre><p>
        What does <tt>cflow(<i><tt>P</tt></i>) &amp;&amp;
        cflow(<i><tt>Q</tt></i>)</tt> pick out?  Well, it
        picks out each join point that is in both the control flow of
        <i><tt>P</tt></i> and in the control flow of
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>.  So...
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
          P ---------------------
            \
             \  cflow of P
              \
               \
                \
  Q -------------\-------
    \             \
     \  cflow of Q \ cflow(P) &amp;&amp; cflow(Q)
      \             \
</pre><p>
        Note that <i><tt>P</tt></i> and
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i> might not have any join points in
        common... but their control flows might have join points in common.
      </p><p>
        But what does <tt>cflow(<i><tt>P</tt></i>
        &amp;&amp; <i><tt>Q</tt></i>)</tt> mean?  Well, it
        means the control flow of those join points that are both picked
        out by <i><tt>P</tt></i> and picked out by
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
   P &amp;&amp; Q -------------------
          \
           \ cflow of (P &amp;&amp; Q)
            \
</pre><p>
        and if there are <span class="emphasis"><i>no</i></span> join points that are both
        picked by <i><tt>P</tt></i> and picked out by
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>, then there's no chance that there are
        any join points in the control flow of
        <tt>(<i><tt>P</tt></i> &amp;&amp;
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>)</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Here's some code that expresses this.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        foo();
    }
    static void foo() {
        goo();
    }
    static void goo() {
        System.out.println("hi");
    }
}

aspect A  {
    pointcut fooPC(): execution(void Test.foo());
    pointcut gooPC(): execution(void Test.goo());
    pointcut printPC(): call(void java.io.PrintStream.println(String));

    before(): cflow(fooPC()) &amp;&amp; cflow(gooPC()) &amp;&amp; printPC() &amp;&amp; !within(A) {
        System.out.println("should occur");
    }

    before(): cflow(fooPC() &amp;&amp; gooPC()) &amp;&amp; printPC() &amp;&amp; !within(A) {
        System.out.println("should not occur");
    }
}
</pre><p>
          The <tt>!within(<i><tt>A</tt></i>)</tt>
          pointcut above is required to avoid the <tt>printPC</tt> 
          pointcut applying to the <tt>System.out.println</tt>
          call in the advice body. If this was not present a recursive call
          would result as the pointcut would apply to its own advice.
          (See <a href="#pitfalls-infiniteLoops" title="Infinite loops">the section called &#8220;Infinite loops&#8221;</a> for more details.)
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pointcut-parameters"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcut-parameters"></a>Pointcut Parameters</h3></div></div><p>
        Consider again the first pointcut definition in this chapter:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut setter(): target(Point) &amp;&amp;
                     (call(void setX(int)) ||
                      call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
        As we've seen, this pointcut picks out each call to
        <tt>setX(int)</tt> or <tt>setY(int)</tt>
        methods where the target is an instance of
        <tt>Point</tt>. The pointcut is given the name
        <tt>setters</tt> and no parameters on the left-hand
        side. An empty parameter list means that none of the context from
        the join points is published from this pointcut.  But consider
        another version of version of this pointcut definition:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut setter(Point p): target(p) &amp;&amp;
                            (call(void setX(int)) ||
                             call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
        This version picks out exactly the same join points. But in this
        version, the pointcut has one parameter of type
        <tt>Point</tt>. This means that any advice that uses this
        pointcut has access to a <tt>Point</tt> from each join
        point picked out by the pointcut.  Inside the pointcut definition
        this <tt>Point</tt> is named <tt>p</tt> is
        available, and according to the right-hand side of the definition,
        that <tt>Point p</tt> comes from the
        <tt>target</tt> of each matched join point.
      </p><p>
        Here's another example that illustrates the flexible mechanism for
        defining pointcut parameters:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut testEquality(Point p): target(Point) &amp;&amp;
                                  args(p) &amp;&amp;
                                  call(boolean equals(Object));
</pre><p>
        This pointcut also has a parameter of type
        <tt>Point</tt>.  Similar to the
        <tt>setters</tt> pointcut, this means that anyone using
        this pointcut has access to a <tt>Point</tt> from each
        join point.  But in this case, looking at the right-hand side we
        find that the object named in the parameters is not the target
        <tt>Point</tt> object that receives the call; it's the
        argument (also of type <tt>Point</tt>) passed to the
        <tt>equals</tt> method when some other
        <tt>Point</tt> is the target. If we wanted access to both
        <tt>Point</tt>s, then the pointcut definition that would
        expose target <tt>Point p1</tt> and argument
        <tt>Point p2</tt> would be
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut testEquality(Point p1, Point p2): target(p1) &amp;&amp;
                                             args(p2) &amp;&amp;
                                             call(boolean equals(Object));
</pre><p>
        Let's look at another variation of the <tt>setters</tt> pointcut:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut setter(Point p, int newval): target(p) &amp;&amp;
                                      args(newval) &amp;&amp;
                                      (call(void setX(int)) ||
                                       call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
        In this case, a <tt>Point</tt> object and an
        <tt>int</tt> value are exposed by the named
        pointcut. Looking at the the right-hand side of the definition, we
        find that the <tt>Point</tt> object is the target object,
        and the <tt>int</tt> value is the called method's
        argument.
      </p><p>
        The use of pointcut parameters is relatively flexible. The most
        important rule is that all the pointcut parameters must be bound at
        every join point picked out by the pointcut. So, for example, the
        following pointcut definition will result in a compilation error:

<pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut badPointcut(Point p1, Point p2):
      (target(p1) &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int))) ||
      (target(p2) &amp;&amp; call(void setY(int)));
</pre>

        because <tt>p1</tt> is only bound when calling
        <tt>setX</tt>, and <tt>p2</tt> is only bound
        when calling <tt>setY</tt>, but the pointcut picks out
        all of these join points and tries to bind both
        <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="example"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="example"></a>Example: <tt>HandleLiveness</tt></h3></div></div><p>
        The example below consists of two object classes (plus an exception
        class) and one aspect. Handle objects delegate their public,
        non-static operations to their <tt>Partner</tt>
        objects. The aspect <tt>HandleLiveness</tt> ensures that,
        before the delegations, the partner exists and is alive, or else it
        throws an exception.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class Handle {
    Partner partner = new Partner();

    public void foo() { partner.foo(); }
    public void bar(int x) { partner.bar(x); }

	  During compilation, AspectJ processes pointcuts in order to try and optimize matching performance.  Examining code and determining
	  if each join point matches (statically or dynamically) a given pointcut is a costly process.
	  (A dynamic match means the match cannot be fully determined from static analysis and a test will be placed in the code
	  to determine if there is an actual match when the code is running).
	  On first encountering a pointcut declaration, AspectJ will rewrite it into an optimal form for the matching process.
	  What does this mean?  Basically pointcuts are rewritten in DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) and the components of the pointcut
	  are sorted such that those components that are cheaper to evaluate are checked first.  This means users do not have to worry
	  about understanding the performance of various pointcut designators and may supply them in any order in their
	  pointcut declarations.
      </p><p>
      However, AspectJ can only work with what it is told, and for optimal performance of matching the user should think
      about what they are trying to achieve and narrow the search space for matches as much as they can in the definition.
      Basically there are three kinds of pointcut designator: kinded, scoping and context:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e1604"></a>
	      Kinded designators are those which select a particular kind of join point. For example: execution, get, set, call, handler
    	</li><li><a name="d0e1606"></a>
         Scoping designators are those which select a group of join points of interest (of probably many kinds). For example: within, withincode
    	</li><li><a name="d0e1608"></a>
         Contextual designators are those that match (and optionally bind) based on context. For example: this, target, @annotation
    	</li></ul></div><p>
      A well written pointcut should 
      try and include at least the first two types (kinded and scoping), whilst the contextual designators may be included if wishing to
      match based on join point context, or bind that context for use in the advice.  Supplying either just a kinded designator or 
      just a contextual designator will work but could affect weaving performance (time and memory used) 
      due to all the extra processing and analysis. 
      Scoping designators are very fast to match, they can very quickly dismiss groups of join points that should not be further 
      processed - that is why a good pointcut should always include one if possible.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><a name="language-advice"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="language-advice"></a>Advice</h2></div></div><p>
      Advice defines pieces of aspect implementation that execute at
      well-defined points in the execution of the program. Those points can
      be given either by named pointcuts (like the ones you've seen above)
      or by anonymous pointcuts. Here is an example of an advice on a named
      pointcut:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut setter(Point p1, int newval): target(p1) &amp;&amp; args(newval)
                                         (call(void setX(int) ||
                                          call(void setY(int)));

  before(Point p1, int newval): setter(p1, newval) {
      System.out.println("About to set something in " + p1 +
                         " to the new value " + newval);
  }
</pre><p>
      And here is exactly the same example, but using an anonymous
      pointcut:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  before(Point p1, int newval): target(p1) &amp;&amp; args(newval)
                                (call(void setX(int)) ||
                                 call(void setY(int))) {
      System.out.println("About to set something in " + p1 +
                         " to the new value " + newval);
  }
</pre><p>
      Here are examples of the different advice:
    </p><p>
      This before advice runs just before the join points picked out by the
      (anonymous) pointcut:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  before(Point p, int x): target(p) &amp;&amp; args(x) &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int)) {
      if (!p.assertX(x)) return;
  }
</pre><p>
      This after advice runs just after each join point picked out by the
      (anonymous) pointcut, regardless of whether it returns normally or throws
      an exception:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  after(Point p, int x): target(p) &amp;&amp; args(x) &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int)) {
      if (!p.assertX(x)) throw new PostConditionViolation();
  }
</pre><p>
      This after returning advice runs just after each join point picked
      out by the (anonymous) pointcut, but only if it returns normally.
      The return value can be accessed, and is named <tt>x</tt>
      here.  After the advice runs, the return value is returned:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  after(Point p) returning(int x): target(p) &amp;&amp; call(int getX()) {
      System.out.println("Returning int value " + x + " for p = " + p);
  }
</pre><p>
      This after throwing advice runs just after each join point picked out by
      the (anonymous) pointcut, but only when it throws an exception of type
      <tt>Exception</tt>.  Here the exception value can be accessed
      with the name <tt>e</tt>.  The advice re-raises the exception
      after it's done:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  after() throwing(Exception e): target(Point) &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int)) {
      System.out.println(e);
  }
</pre><p>
      This around advice traps the execution of the join point; it runs
      <span class="emphasis"><i>instead</i></span> of the join point.  The original action
      associated with the join point can be invoked through the special
      <tt>proceed</tt> call:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
void around(Point p, int x): target(p)
                          &amp;&amp; args(x)
                          &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int)) {
    if (p.assertX(x)) proceed(p, x);
    p.releaseResources();
}
</pre></div><div class="sect1"><a name="language-interType"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="language-interType"></a>Inter-type declarations</h2></div></div><p>
      Aspects can declare members (fields, methods, and constructors) that
      are owned by other types.  These are called inter-type members.
      Aspects can also declare that other types implement new interfaces or
      extend a new class.  Here are examples of some such inter-type
      declarations:
    </p><p>
      This declares that each <tt>Server</tt> has a
      <tt>boolean</tt> field named <tt>disabled</tt>,
      initialized to <tt>false</tt>:

<pre class="programlisting">
  private boolean Server.disabled = false;
</pre>

      It is declared <tt>private</tt>, which means that it is
      private <span class="emphasis"><i>to the aspect</i></span>: only code in the aspect
      can see the field.  And even if <tt>Server</tt> has
      another private field named <tt>disabled</tt> (declared in
      <tt>Server</tt> or in another aspect) there won't be a name
      collision, since no reference to <tt>disabled</tt> will be
      ambiguous.
    </p><p>
      This declares that each <tt>Point</tt> has an
      <tt>int</tt> method named <tt>getX</tt> with no
      arguments that returns whatever <tt>this.x</tt> is:

<pre class="programlisting">
  public int Point.getX() { return this.x; }
</pre>

      Inside the body, <tt>this</tt> is the
      <tt>Point</tt> object currently executing.  Because the
      method is publically declared any code can call it, but if there is
      some other <tt>Point.getX()</tt> declared there will be a
      compile-time conflict.
    </p><p>
      This publically declares a two-argument constructor for
      <tt>Point</tt>:

<pre class="programlisting">
  public Point.new(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }
</pre>

    </p><p>
      This publicly declares that each <tt>Point</tt> has an
      <tt>int</tt> field named <tt>x</tt>, initialized
      to zero:

<pre class="programlisting">
  public int Point.x = 0;
</pre>

      Because this is publically declared, it is an error if
      <tt>Point</tt> already has a field named
      <tt>x</tt> (defined by <tt>Point</tt> or by
      another aspect).
    </p><p>
      This declares that the <tt>Point</tt> class implements the
      <tt>Comparable</tt> interface:

<pre class="programlisting">
  declare parents: Point implements Comparable;
</pre>

      Of course, this will be an error unless <tt>Point</tt>
      defines the methods required by <tt>Comparable</tt>.
    </p><p>
      This declares that the <tt>Point</tt> class extends the
      <tt>GeometricObject</tt> class.

<pre class="programlisting">
  declare parents: Point extends GeometricObject;
</pre>
    </p><p>
      An aspect can have several inter-type declarations.  For example, the
      following declarations

<pre class="programlisting">
  public String Point.name;
  public void Point.setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
</pre>

      publicly declare that Point has both a String field
      <tt>name</tt> and a <tt>void</tt> method
      <tt>setName(String)</tt> (which refers to the
      <tt>name</tt> field declared by the aspect).
    </p><p>
      An inter-type member can only have one target type, but often you may
      wish to declare the same member on more than one type.  This can be
      done by using an inter-type member in combination with a private
      interface:

<pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
    private interface HasName {}
    declare parents: (Point || Line || Square) implements HasName;

    private String HasName.name;
    public  String HasName.getName()  { return name; }
  }
</pre>

      This declares a marker interface <tt>HasName</tt>, and also declares that any
      type that is either <tt>Point</tt>,
      <tt>Line</tt>, or <tt>Square</tt> implements that
      interface.  It also privately declares that all <tt>HasName</tt>
      object have a <tt>String</tt> field called
      <tt>name</tt>, and publically declares that all
      <tt>HasName</tt> objects have a <tt>String</tt>
      method <tt>getName()</tt> (which refers to the privately
      declared <tt>name</tt> field).
    </p><p>
      As you can see from the above example, an aspect can declare that
      interfaces have fields and methods, even non-constant fields and
      methods with bodies.
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="inter-type-scope"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inter-type-scope"></a>Inter-type Scope</h3></div></div><p>
        AspectJ allows private and package-protected (default) inter-type declarations in
        addition to public inter-type declarations. Private means private in
        relation to the aspect, not necessarily the target type. So, if an
        aspect makes a private inter-type declaration of a field

<pre class="programlisting">
  private int Foo.x;
</pre>

        Then code in the aspect can refer to <tt>Foo</tt>'s
        <tt>x</tt> field, but nobody else can. Similarly, if an
        aspect makes a package-protected introduction,
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  int Foo.x;
</pre><p>
        then everything in the aspect's package (which may or may not be
        <tt>Foo</tt>'s package) can access <tt>x</tt>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="example-pointassertions"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="example-pointassertions"></a>Example: <tt>PointAssertions</tt></h3></div></div><p>
        The example below consists of one class and one aspect. The aspect
        privately declares the assertion methods of
        <tt>Point</tt>, <tt>assertX</tt> and
        <tt>assertY</tt>. It also guards calls to
        <tt>setX</tt> and <tt>setY</tt> with calls to
        these assertion methods.  The assertion methods are declared
        privately because other parts of the program (including the code in
        <tt>Point</tt>) have no business accessing the assert
        methods.  Only the code inside of the aspect can call those
        methods.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class Point  {
      int x, y;

      public void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }
      public void setY(int y) { this.y = y; }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Point p = new Point();
          p.setX(3); p.setY(333);
      }
  }

  aspect PointAssertions {

      private boolean Point.assertX(int x) {
          return (x &lt;= 100 &amp;&amp; x &gt;= 0);
      }
      private boolean Point.assertY(int y) {
          return (y &lt;= 100 &amp;&amp; y &gt;= 0);
      }

      before(Point p, int x): target(p) &amp;&amp; args(x) &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int)) {
          if (!p.assertX(x)) {
              System.out.println("Illegal value for x"); return;
          }
      }
      before(Point p, int y): target(p) &amp;&amp; args(y) &amp;&amp; call(void setY(int)) {
          if (!p.assertY(y)) {
              System.out.println("Illegal value for y"); return;
          }
      }
  }
</pre></div></div><div class="sect1"><a name="language-thisJoinPoint"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="language-thisJoinPoint"></a>thisJoinPoint</h2></div></div><p>
      AspectJ provides a special reference variable,
      <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt>, that contains reflective
      information about the current join point for the advice to use. The
      <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> variable can only be used in the
      context of advice, just like <tt>this</tt> can only be used
      in the context of non-static methods and variable initializers. In
      advice, <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> is an object of type <a href="../api/org/aspectj/lang/JoinPoint.html" target="_top"><tt>org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint</tt></a>.
    </p><p>
      One way to use it is simply to print it out.  Like all Java objects,
      <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> has a <tt>toString()</tt>
      method that makes quick-and-dirty tracing easy:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect TraceNonStaticMethods {
      before(Point p): target(p) &amp;&amp; call(* *(..)) {
          System.out.println("Entering " + thisJoinPoint + " in " + p);
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      The type of <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> includes a rich
      reflective class hierarchy of signatures, and can be used to access
      both static and dynamic information about join points such as the
      arguments of the join point:

<pre class="programlisting">
  thisJoinPoint.getArgs()
</pre>

      In addition, it holds an object consisting of all the static
      information about the join point such as corresponding line number
      and static signature:

<pre class="programlisting">
  thisJoinPoint.getStaticPart()
</pre>

      If you only need the static information about the join point, you may
      access the static part of the join point directly with the special
      variable <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt>.  Using
      <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt> will avoid the run-time
      creation of the join point object that may be necessary when using
      <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> directly.
    </p><p>It is always the case that
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
   thisJoinPointStaticPart == thisJoinPoint.getStaticPart()

   thisJoinPoint.getKind() == thisJoinPointStaticPart.getKind()
   thisJoinPoint.getSignature() == thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature()
   thisJoinPoint.getSourceLocation() == thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSourceLocation()
</pre><p>
      One more reflective variable is available:
      <tt>thisEnclosingJoinPointStaticPart</tt>.  This, like
      <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt>, only holds the static
      part of a join point, but it is not the current but the enclosing
      join point.  So, for example, it is possible to print out the calling
      source location (if available) with
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
   before() : execution (* *(..)) {
     System.err.println(thisEnclosingJoinPointStaticPart.getSourceLocation())
   }

      Compiling most examples is straightforward. Go the
      <tt><i><tt>InstallDir</tt></i>/examples</tt>
      directory, and look for a <tt>.lst</tt> file in one of
      the example subdirectories. Use the <tt>-arglist</tt>

      To run the examples, your classpath must include the AspectJ run-time
      Java archive (<tt>aspectjrt.jar</tt>). You may either set the

      This section presents two basic techniques of using AspectJ, one each
      from the two fundamental ways of capturing crosscutting concerns:
      with dynamic join points and advice, and with static
      introduction. Advice changes an application's behavior. Introduction
      changes both an application's behavior and its structure.
    </p><p>
      The first example, <a href="#examples-joinPoints" title="Join Points and thisJoinPoint">the section called &#8220;Join Points and <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt>&#8221;</a>, is about
      gathering and using information about the join point that has
      triggered some advice. The second example, <a href="#examples-roles" title="Roles and Views">the section called &#8220;Roles and Views&#8221;</a>, concerns a crosscutting view of an
      existing class hierarchy. </p><div class="sect2"><a name="examples-joinPoints"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="examples-joinPoints"></a>Join Points and <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt></h3></div></div><p>
        (The code for this example is in
        <tt><i><tt>InstallDir</tt></i>/examples/tjp</tt>.)
      </p><p>
        A join point is some point in the execution of a program together
        with a view into the execution context when that point occurs. Join
        points are picked out by pointcuts.  When a program reaches a join
        point, advice on that join point may run in addition to (or instead
        of) the join point itself.
      </p><p>
        When using a pointcut that picks out join points of a single kind
        by name, typicaly the the advice will know exactly what kind of
        join point it is associated with.  The pointcut may even publish
        context about the join point.  Here, for example, since the only
        join points picked out by the pointcut are calls of a certain
        method, we can get the target value and one of the argument values
        of the method calls directly.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
before(Point p, int x): target(p)
                     &amp;&amp; args(x)
                     &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int)) {
    if (!p.assertX(x)) {
        System.out.println("Illegal value for x"); return;
    }
}
</pre><p>
       But sometimes the shape of the join point is not so clear.  For
       instance, suppose a complex application is being debugged, and we
       want to trace when any method of some class is executed.  The
       pointcut

</pre><p>
        will pick out each execution join point of every method defined
        within <tt>ProblemClass</tt>.  Since advice executes
        at each join point picked out by the pointcut, we can reasonably
        ask which join point was reached.

        Like advice, inter-type declarations are members of an aspect. They
        declare members that act as if they were defined on another class.
        Unlike advice, inter-type declarations affect not only the behavior
        of the application, but also the structural relationship between an
        application's classes.
      </p><p>
        This is crucial: Publically affecting the class structure of an
        application makes these modifications available to other components
        of the application.
      </p><p>
        Aspects can declare inter-type

        <div class="itemizedlist"><ul compact><li><a name="d0e2235"></a>fields</li><li><a name="d0e2237"></a>methods</li><li><a name="d0e2239"></a>constructors</li></ul></div>

        and can also declare that target types

        This example provides three illustrations of the use of inter-type
        declarations to encapsulate roles or views of a class. The class
        our aspect will be dealing with, <tt>Point</tt>, is a
        simple class with rectangular and polar coordinates. Our inter-type
        declarations will make the class <tt>Point</tt>, in
        turn, cloneable, hashable, and comparable. These facilities are
        provided by AspectJ without having to modify the code for the class
        <tt>Point</tt>.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e2259"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e2259"></a>The <tt>Point</tt> class</h4></div></div><p>The <tt>Point</tt> class defines geometric points
          whose interface includes polar and rectangular coordinates, plus some
          simple operations to relocate points. <tt>Point</tt>'s
          implementation has attributes for both its polar and rectangular
          coordinates, plus flags to indicate which currently reflect the
          position of the point. Some operations cause the polar coordinates to
          be updated from the rectangular, and some have the opposite effect.
          This implementation, which is in intended to give the minimum number
          of conversions between coordinate systems, has the property that not
          all the attributes stored in a <tt>Point</tt> object
          are necessary to give a canonical representation such as might be
          used for storing, comparing, cloning or making hash codes from
          points. Thus the aspects, though simple, are not totally trivial.
        </p><p>
          The diagram below gives an overview of the aspects and their
          interaction with the class <tt>Point</tt>.</p><p>

          This first aspect is responsible for
          <tt>Point</tt>'s implementation of the
          <tt>Cloneable</tt> interface.  It declares that
          <tt>Point implements Cloneable</tt> with a
          <tt>declare parents</tt> form, and also publically
          declares a specialized <tt>Point</tt>'s
          <tt>clone()</tt> method.  In Java, all objects inherit
          the method <tt>clone</tt> from the class
          <tt>Object</tt>, but an object is not cloneable
          unless its class also implements the interface
          <tt>Cloneable</tt>.  In addition, classes
          frequently have requirements over and above the simple
          bit-for-bit copying that <tt>Object.clone</tt> does. In
          our case, we want to update a <tt>Point</tt>'s
          coordinate systems before we actually clone the
          <tt>Point</tt>. So our aspect makes sure that
          <tt>Point</tt> overrides
          <tt>Object.clone</tt> with a new method that does what
          we want.

          <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt> methods
          in order to make <tt>Point</tt>s hashable.
        </p><p>
          The method <tt>Object.hashCode</tt> returns an 
          integer, suitable for use as a hash table key.  It is not required
          that two objects which are not equal (according to the 
          <tt>equals</tt> method) return different integer
          results from <tt>hashCode</tt> but it can
          improve performance when the integer is used as a key into a 
          data structure.  However, any two objects which are equal 
          must return the same integer value from a call to 
          <tt>hashCode</tt>.  Since the default implementation
          of <tt>Object.equals</tt> returns <tt>true</tt>
          only when two objects are identical, we need to redefine both
          <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt> to work
          correctly with objects of type <tt>Point</tt>. For
          example, we want two <tt>Point</tt> objects to test
          equal when they have the same <tt>x</tt> and
          <tt>y</tt> values, or the same <tt>rho</tt> and
          <tt>theta</tt> values, not just when they refer to the same
          object. We do this by overriding the methods

          class <tt>Point</tt>.
        </p><p>
          So <tt>HashablePoint</tt> declares
          <tt>Point</tt>'s <tt>hashCode</tt> and
          <tt>equals</tt> methods, using
          <tt>Point</tt>'s rectangular coordinates to
          generate a hash code and to test for equality. The
          <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> coordinates are
          obtained using the appropriate get methods, which ensure the
          rectangular coordinates are up-to-date before returning their
          values.
        </p><p>
          And again, we supply a <tt>main</tt> method in the

      </p><p>
        Writing a class that provides tracing functionality is easy: a
        couple of functions, a boolean flag for turning tracing on and
        off, a choice for an output stream, maybe some code for
        formatting the output -- these are all elements that
        <tt>Trace</tt> classes have been known to
        have. <tt>Trace</tt> classes may be highly
        sophisticated, too, if the task of tracing the execution of a
        program demands it.
      </p><p>
        But developing the support for tracing is just one part of the
        effort of inserting tracing into a program, and, most likely, not
        the biggest part. The other part of the effort is calling the
        tracing functions at appropriate times. In large systems, this
        interaction with the tracing support can be overwhelming.  Plus,
        tracing is one of those things that slows the system down, so
        these calls should often be pulled out of the system before the
        product is shipped. For these reasons, it is not unusual for
        developers to write ad-hoc scripting programs that rewrite the
        source code by inserting/deleting trace calls before and after
        the method bodies.

        AspectJ can be used for some of these tracing concerns in a less
        ad-hoc way.  Tracing can be seen as a concern that crosscuts the
        entire system and as such is amenable to encapsulation in an
        aspect.  In addition, it is fairly independent of what the system
        is doing. Therefore tracing is one of those kind of system
        aspects that can potentially be plugged in and unplugged without
        any side-effects in the basic functionality of the system.

        In a first attempt to insert tracing in this application, we will
        start by writing a <tt>Trace</tt> class that is
        exactly what we would write if we didn't have aspects.  The
        implementation is in <tt>version1/Trace.java</tt>.  Its
        public interface is:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
public class Trace {
    public static int TRACELEVEL = 0;
    public static void initStream(PrintStream s) {...}
    public static void traceEntry(String str) {...}
    public static void traceExit(String str) {...}
}
</pre><p>
        If we didn't have AspectJ, we would have to insert calls to
        <tt>traceEntry</tt> and <tt>traceExit</tt> in
        all methods and constructors we wanted to trace, and to initialize
        <tt>TRACELEVEL</tt> and the stream. If we wanted to trace
        all the methods and constructors in our example, that would amount
        to around 40 calls, and we would hope we had not forgotten any
        method. But we can do that more consistently and reliably with the
        following aspect (found in
        <tt>version1/TraceMyClasses.java</tt>):
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect TraceMyClasses {
    pointcut myClass(): within(TwoDShape) || within(Circle) || within(Square);
    pointcut myConstructor(): myClass() &amp;&amp; execution(new(..));
    pointcut myMethod(): myClass() &amp;&amp; execution(* *(..));

    before (): myConstructor() {
        Trace.traceEntry("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature());
    }
    after(): myConstructor() {
        Trace.traceExit("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature());
    }

    before (): myMethod() {
        Trace.traceEntry("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature());
    }
    after(): myMethod() {
        Trace.traceExit("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature());
    }
}</pre><p>
        This aspect performs the tracing calls at appropriate
        times. According to this aspect, tracing is performed at the
        entrance and exit of every method and constructor defined within
        the shape hierarchy.
      </p><p>
        What is printed at before and after each of the traced join points
        is the signature of the method executing. Since the signature is
        static information, we can get it through
        <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt>.
      </p><p>

        Another way to accomplish the same thing would be to write a
        reusable tracing aspect that can be used not only for these
        application classes, but for any class. One way to do this is to
        merge the tracing functionality of
        <tt>Trace&#8212;version1</tt> with the crosscutting
        support of <tt>TraceMyClasses&#8212;version1</tt>. We end
        up with a <tt>Trace</tt> aspect (found in
        <tt>version2/Trace.java</tt>) with the following public
        interface
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
abstract aspect Trace {

    public static int TRACELEVEL = 2;
    public static void initStream(PrintStream s) {...}
    protected static void traceEntry(String str) {...}
    protected static void traceExit(String str) {...}
    abstract pointcut myClass();
}
</pre><p>
        In order to use it, we need to define our own subclass that knows
        about our application classes, in
        <tt>version2/TraceMyClasses.java</tt>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
public aspect TraceMyClasses extends Trace {
    pointcut myClass(): within(TwoDShape) || within(Circle) || within(Square);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Trace.TRACELEVEL = 2;
        Trace.initStream(System.err);
        ExampleMain.main(args);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        Notice that we've simply made the pointcut
        <tt>classes</tt>, that was an abstract pointcut in the
        super-aspect, concrete. To run this version of tracing, go to the
        directory <tt>examples</tt> and type:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  ajc -argfile tracing/tracev2.lst
</pre><p>
        The file tracev2.lst lists the application classes as well as this
        version of the files Trace.java and TraceMyClasses.java. Running
        the main method of
        <tt>tracing.version2.TraceMyClasses</tt> should
        output exactly the same trace information as that from version 1.
      </p><p>
        The entire implementation of the new <tt>Trace</tt>
        class is:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

    after(): myMethod() {
        traceExit("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature());
    }
}
</pre><p>
        This version differs from version 1 in several subtle ways. The
        first thing to notice is that this <tt>Trace</tt>
        class merges the functional part of tracing with the crosscutting
        of the tracing calls. That is, in version 1, there was a sharp
        separation between the tracing support (the class
        <tt>Trace</tt>) and the crosscutting usage of it (by
        the class <tt>TraceMyClasses</tt>). In this version
        those two things are merged. That's why the description of this
        class explicitly says that "Trace messages are printed before and
        after constructors and methods are," which is what we wanted in the
        first place. That is, the placement of the calls, in this version,
        is established by the aspect class itself, leaving less opportunity
        for misplacing calls.</p><p>
        A consequence of this is that there is no need for providing
        <tt>traceEntry</tt> and <tt>traceExit</tt> as
        public operations of this class. You can see that they were
        classified as protected. They are supposed to be internal
        implementation details of the advice.
      </p><p>
        The key piece of this aspect is the abstract pointcut classes that
        serves as the base for the definition of the pointcuts constructors
        and methods. Even though <tt>classes</tt> is
        abstract, and therefore no concrete classes are mentioned, we can
        put advice on it, as well as on the pointcuts that are based on
        it. The idea is "we don't know exactly what the pointcut will be,
        but when we do, here's what we want to do with it." In some ways,
        abstract pointcuts are similar to abstract methods. Abstract
        methods don't provide the implementation, but you know that the
        concrete subclasses will, so you can invoke those methods.

      </p><p>
        This example examines an aspect that makes Point objects into 
        Java beans with bound properties.
      </p><p>
        Java beans are reusable software components that can be visually
        manipulated in a builder tool. The requirements for an object to be
        a bean are few. Beans must define a no-argument constructor and
        must be either <tt>Serializable</tt> or
        <tt>Externalizable</tt>. Any properties of the object
        that are to be treated as bean properties should be indicated by
        the presence of appropriate <tt>get</tt> and
        <tt>set</tt> methods whose names are
        <tt>get</tt><span class="emphasis"><i>property</i></span> and
        <tt>set </tt><span class="emphasis"><i>property</i></span> where
        <span class="emphasis"><i>property</i></span> is the name of a field in the bean
        class. Some bean properties, known as bound properties, fire events
        whenever their values change so that any registered listeners (such
        as, other beans) will be informed of those changes. Making a bound
        property involves keeping a list of registered listeners, and
        creating and dispatching event objects in methods that change the
        property values, such as set<span class="emphasis"><i>property</i></span>
        methods.
      </p><p>
        <tt>Point</tt> is a simple class representing points
        with rectangular coordinates. <tt>Point</tt> does not
        know anything about being a bean: there are set methods for
        <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> but they do not fire
        events, and the class is not serializable. Bound is an aspect that
        makes <tt>Point</tt> a serializable class and makes
        its <tt>get</tt> and <tt>set</tt> methods
        support the bound property protocol.

        The <tt>BoundPoint</tt> aspect is responsible for
        <tt>Point</tt>'s "beanness". The first thing it does is
        privately declare that each <tt>Point</tt> has a
        <tt>support</tt> field that holds reference to an
        instance of <tt>PropertyChangeSupport</tt>.  

<pre class="programlisting">
  private PropertyChangeSupport Point.support = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);
</pre>

        The property change support object must be constructed with a
        reference to the bean for which it is providing support, so it is
        initialized by passing it <tt>this</tt>, an instance of
        <tt>Point</tt>.  Since the <tt>support</tt>
        field is private declared in the aspect, only the code in the
        aspect can refer to it.
      </p><p>
        The aspect also declares <tt>Point</tt>'s methods for
        registering and managing listeners for property change events,
        which delegate the work to the property change support object:

<pre class="programlisting">
  public void Point.addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener){
    support.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);
  }
  public void Point.addPropertyChangeListener(String propertyName,
                                              PropertyChangeListener listener){

    support.addPropertyChangeListener(propertyName, listener);
  }
  public void Point.removePropertyChangeListener(String propertyName,
                                                 PropertyChangeListener listener) {
    support.removePropertyChangeListener(propertyName, listener);
  }
  public void Point.removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {
    support.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);
  }
  public void Point.hasListeners(String propertyName) {
    support.hasListeners(propertyName);
  }
</pre>
      </p><p>
        The aspect is also responsible for making sure
        <tt>Point</tt> implements the
        <tt>Serializable</tt> interface:

<pre class="programlisting">
  declare parents: Point implements Serializable;
</pre>

        Implementing this interface in Java does not require any methods to
        be implemented. Serialization for <tt>Point</tt>
        objects is provided by the default serialization method.
      </p><p>
        The <tt>setters</tt> pointcut picks out calls to the
        <tt>Point</tt>'s <tt>set</tt> methods: any
        method whose name begins with "<tt>set</tt>" and takes
        one parameter. The around advice on <tt>setters()</tt>
        stores the values of the <tt>X</tt> and
        <tt>Y</tt> properties, calls the original
        <tt>set</tt> method and then fires the appropriate
        property change event according to which set method was
        called. 
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

        (The code for this example is in
	<tt><i><tt>InstallDir</tt></i>/examples/observer</tt>.)
      </p><p>
        This demo illustrates how the Subject/Observer design pattern can be
        coded with aspects. 
      </p><p>
         The demo consists of the following: A colored label is a
         renderable object that has a color that cycles through a set of
         colors, and a number that records the number of cycles it has been
         through. A button is an action item that records when it is
         clicked.
      </p><p>
        With these two kinds of objects, we can build up a Subject/Observer
        relationship in which colored labels observe the clicks of buttons;
        that is, where colored labels are the observers and buttons are the
        subjects.
      </p><p>
        The demo is designed and implemented using the Subject/Observer
        design pattern. The remainder of this example explains the classes
        and aspects of this demo, and tells you how to run it.

        The generic parts of the protocol are the interfaces
        <tt>Subject</tt> and <tt>Observer</tt>,
        and the abstract aspect
        <tt>SubjectObserverProtocol</tt>. The
        <tt>Subject</tt> interface is simple, containing
        methods to add, remove, and view <tt>Observer</tt>
        objects, and a method for getting data about state changes:

</pre><p> 
        The <tt>Observer</tt> interface is just as simple,
        with methods to set and get <tt>Subject</tt> objects,
        and a method to call when the subject gets updated.

</pre><p>
        The <tt>SubjectObserverProtocol</tt> aspect contains
        within it all of the generic parts of the protocol, namely, how to
        fire the <tt>Observer</tt> objects' update methods
        when some state changes in a subject.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  abstract aspect SubjectObserverProtocol {

      abstract pointcut stateChanges(Subject s);

      after(Subject s): stateChanges(s) {

  }
</pre><p>
        Note that this aspect does three things. It define an abstract
        pointcut that extending aspects can override. It defines advice
        that should run after the join points of the pointcut. And it
        declares an inter-tpye field and two inter-type methods so that
        each <tt>Observer</tt> can hold onto its <tt>Subject</tt>.

        a button is clicked.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

  }
</pre><p>
        Note that this class knows nothing about being a Subject.
      </p><p>
        ColorLabel objects are labels that support the void colorCycle()
        method. Again, they know nothing about being an observer.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

          setBackground(colors[colorIndex]);
          setText("" + cycleCount);
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        Finally, the <tt>SubjectObserverProtocolImpl</tt>
        implements the subject/observer protocol, with
        <tt>Button</tt> objects as subjects and

      </p><pre class="programlisting">

    public Object Button.getData() { return this; }

    }

    pointcut stateChanges(Subject s):
        target(s) &amp;&amp;
        call(void Button.click());

}</pre><p>
        It does this by assuring that <tt>Button</tt> and
        <tt>ColorLabel</tt> implement the appropriate
        interfaces, declaring that they implement the methods required by
        those interfaces, and providing a definition for the abstract
        <tt>stateChanges</tt> pointcut. Now, every time a
        <tt>Button</tt> is clicked, all

      </p><p>
	This example illustrates some ways that dependent concerns can be
	encoded with aspects. It uses an example system comprising a simple
	model of telephone connections to which timing and billing features
	are added using aspects, where the billing feature depends upon the
	timing feature.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e3049"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e3049"></a>The Application</h4></div></div><p>
	  The example application is a simple simulation of a telephony
	  system in which customers make, accept, merge and hang-up both
	  local and long distance calls. The application architecture is in
	  three layers.
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e3055"></a>
	      The basic objects provide basic functionality to simulate
	      customers, calls and connections (regular calls have one
	      connection, conference calls have more than one).
	    </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e3058"></a>
	      The timing feature is concerned with timing the connections
	      and keeping the total connection time per customer. Aspects
	      are used to add a timer to each connection and to manage the
	      total time per customer.
	    </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e3061"></a>
	      The billing feature is concerned with charging customers for
	      the calls they make. Aspects are used to calculate a charge
	      per connection and, upon termination of a connection, to add
	      the charge to the appropriate customer's bill. The billing
	      aspect builds upon the timing aspect: it uses a pointcut
	      defined in Timing and it uses the timers that are associated
	      with connections.
	    </p></li></ul></div><p>
          The simulation of system has three configurations: basic, timing
          and billing. Programs for the three configurations are in classes
          <tt>BasicSimulation</tt>,
          <tt>TimingSimulation</tt> and
          <tt>BillingSimulation</tt>. These share a common
          superclass <tt>AbstractSimulation</tt>, which
          defines the method run with the simulation itself and the method
          wait used to simulate elapsed time.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e3078"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e3078"></a>The Basic Objects</h4></div></div><p>
          The telecom simulation comprises the classes
          <tt>Customer</tt>, <tt>Call</tt> and
          the abstract class <tt>Connection</tt> with its two
          concrete subclasses <tt>Local</tt> and
          <tt>LongDistance</tt>. Customers have a name and a
          numeric area code. They also have methods for managing
          calls. Simple calls are made between one customer (the caller)
          and another (the receiver), a <tt>Connection</tt>
          object is used to connect them. Conference calls between more
          than two customers will involve more than one connection. A
          customer may be involved in many calls at one time.

          One advantage of not exposing the methods traceEntry and
          traceExit as public operations is that we can easily change their
          interface without any dramatic consequences in the rest of the
          code.
        </p><p>
	  Consider, again, the program without AspectJ. Suppose, for
	  example, that at some point later the requirements for tracing
	  change, stating that the trace messages should always include the
	  string representation of the object whose methods are being
	  traced. This can be achieved in at least two ways. One way is
	  keep the interface of the methods <tt>traceEntry</tt>
	  and <tt>traceExit</tt> as it was before,
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
  public static void traceEntry(String str);
  public static void traceExit(String str);
</pre><p>
	  In this case, the caller is responsible for ensuring that the
	  string representation of the object is part of the string given
	  as argument.  So, calls must look like:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
  Trace.traceEntry("Square.distance in " + toString());
</pre><p>
	  Another way is to enforce the requirement with a second argument
	  in the trace operations, e.g.
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
  public static void traceEntry(String str, Object obj);
  public static void traceExit(String str, Object obj);
</pre><p>
	  In this case, the caller is still responsible for sending the
	  right object, but at least there is some guarantees that some
	  object will be passed. The calls will look like:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
  Trace.traceEntry("Square.distance", this);
</pre><p>
	  In either case, this change to the requirements of tracing will
	  have dramatic consequences in the rest of the code -- every call
	  to the trace operations traceEntry and traceExit must be changed!
	</p><p>
	  Here's another advantage of doing tracing with an aspect. We've
	  already seen that in version 2 <tt>traceEntry</tt> and
	  <tt>traceExit</tt> are not publicly exposed. So
	  changing their interfaces, or the way they are used, has only a
	  small effect inside the <tt>Trace</tt>
	  class. Here's a partial view at the implementation of
	  <tt>Trace</tt>, version 3. The differences with
	  respect to version 2 are stressed in the comments:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
abstract aspect Trace {

    public static int TRACELEVEL = 0;
    protected static PrintStream stream = null;
    protected static int callDepth = 0;

    public static void initStream(PrintStream s) {
        stream = s;
    }

    protected static void traceEntry(String str, Object o) {
        if (TRACELEVEL == 0) return;
        if (TRACELEVEL == 2) callDepth++;
        printEntering(str + ": " + o.toString());
    }

    protected static void traceExit(String str, Object o) {
        if (TRACELEVEL == 0) return;
        printExiting(str + ": " + o.toString());
        if (TRACELEVEL == 2) callDepth--;
    }

    private static void printEntering(String str) {
        printIndent();
        stream.println("Entering " + str);
    }

    private static void printExiting(String str) {
        printIndent();
        stream.println("Exiting " + str);
    }

    private static void printIndent() {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; callDepth; i++)
            stream.print("  ");
    }

    abstract pointcut myClass(Object obj);

    pointcut myConstructor(Object obj): myClass(obj) &amp;&amp; execution(new(..));
    pointcut myMethod(Object obj): myClass(obj) &amp;&amp;
        execution(* *(..)) &amp;&amp; !execution(String toString());

    before(Object obj): myConstructor(obj) {
        traceEntry("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature(), obj);
    }
    after(Object obj): myConstructor(obj) {
        traceExit("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature(), obj);
    }

    before(Object obj): myMethod(obj) {
        traceEntry("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature(), obj);
    }
    after(Object obj): myMethod(obj) {
        traceExit("" + thisJoinPointStaticPart.getSignature(), obj);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        As you can see, we decided to apply the first design by preserving
        the interface of the methods <tt>traceEntry</tt> and
        <tt>traceExit</tt>. But it doesn't matter&#8212;we could
        as easily have applied the second design (the code in the directory
        <tt>examples/tracing/version3</tt> has the second
        design).  The point is that the effects of this change in the
        tracing requirements are limited to the
        <tt>Trace</tt> aspect class.
      </p><p>
        One implementation change worth noticing is the specification of
        the pointcuts. They now expose the object. To maintain full
        consistency with the behavior of version 2, we should have included
        tracing for static methods, by defining another pointcut for static
        methods and advising it. We leave that as an exercise.
      </p><p>
        Moreover, we had to exclude the execution join point of the method
        <tt>toString</tt> from the <tt>methods</tt>
        pointcut. The problem here is that <tt>toString</tt> is
        being called from inside the advice.  Therefore if we trace it, we
        will end up in an infinite recursion of calls. This is a subtle
        point, and one that you must be aware when writing advice. If the
        advice calls back to the objects, there is always the possibility
        of recursion. Keep that in mind!
      </p><p>
        In fact, esimply excluding the execution join point may not be
        enough, if there are calls to other traced methods within it -- in
        which case, the restriction should be
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
&amp;&amp; !cflow(execution(String toString()))
</pre><p>
        excluding both the execution of toString methods and all join
        points under that execution.
      </p><p>
        In summary, to implement the change in the tracing requirements we
        had to make a couple of changes in the implementation of the
        <tt>Trace</tt> aspect class, including changing the
        specification of the pointcuts. That's only natural. But the
        implementation changes were limited to this aspect. Without
        aspects, we would have to change the implementation of every
        application class.
      </p><p>

      This chapter consists of a few AspectJ programs that may lead to
      surprising behavior and how to understand them.
    </p></div><div class="sect1"><a name="pitfalls-infiniteLoops"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="pitfalls-infiniteLoops"></a>Infinite loops</h2></div></div><p>
      Here is a Java program with peculiar behavior
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        foo();
        System.out.println("done with call to foo");
    }

    static void foo() {
        try {
            foo();
        } finally {
            foo();
        }
    }
}
</pre><p>
      This program will never reach the println call, but when it aborts
      may have no stack trace. 
    </p><p>
      This silence is caused by multiple StackOverflowExceptions.  First
      the infinite loop in the body of the method generates one, which the
      finally clause tries to handle.  But this finally clause also
      generates an infinite loop which the current JVMs can't handle
      gracefully leading to the completely silent abort.
    </p><p> 
      The following short aspect will also generate this behavior:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect A {
    before(): call(* *(..)) { System.out.println("before"); }
    after():  call(* *(..)) { System.out.println("after"); }
}
</pre><p>
      Why?  Because the call to println is also a call matched by the
      pointcut <tt>call (* *(..))</tt>. We get no output because
      we used simple after() advice.  If the aspect were changed to
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect A {
    before(): call(* *(..)) { System.out.println("before"); }
    after() returning:  call(* *(..)) { System.out.println("after"); }
}
</pre><p>
      Then at least a StackOverflowException with a stack trace would be
      seen.  In both cases, though, the overall problem is advice applying
      within its own body.
    </p><p>
      There's a simple idiom to use if you ever have a worry that your
      advice might apply in this way.  Just restrict the advice from occurring in
      join points caused within the aspect.  So: 
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect A {
    before(): call(* *(..)) &amp;&amp; !within(A) { System.out.println("before"); }
    after() returning:  call(* *(..)) &amp;&amp; !within(A) { System.out.println("after"); }
}
</pre><p>
      Other solutions might be to more closely restrict the pointcut in
      other ways, for example:  
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect A {
    before(): call(* MyObject.*(..))  { System.out.println("before"); }
    after() returning:  call(* MyObject.*(..))  { System.out.println("after"); }
}

      AspectJ extends Java by overlaying a concept of join points onto the
      existing Java semantics and adding a few new program elements to Java:
    </p><p>
      A join point is a well-defined point in the execution of a
      program. These include method and constructor calls, field accesses and
      others described below.
    </p><p>
      A pointcut picks out join points, and exposes some of the values in the
      execution context of those join points. There are several primitive
      pointcut designators, and others can be named and defined by the
      <tt>pointcut</tt> declaration.
    </p><p>
      A piece of advice is code that executes at each join point in a
      pointcut. Advice has access to the values exposed by the
      pointcut. Advice is defined by <tt>before</tt>,
      <tt>after</tt>, and <tt>around</tt> declarations.
    </p><p>
      Inter-type declarations form AspectJ's static crosscutting features,
      that is, is code that may change the type structure of a program, by
      adding to or extending interfaces and classes with new fields,
      constructors, or methods.  Some inter-type declarations are defined
      through an extension of usual method, field, and constructor
      declarations, and other declarations are made with a new
      <tt>declare</tt> keyword.
    </p><p>
      An aspect is a crosscutting type that encapsulates pointcuts, advice,
      and static crosscutting features. By type, we mean Java's notion: a
      modular unit of code, with a well-defined interface, about which it is
      possible to do reasoning at compile time. Aspects are defined by the
      <tt>aspect</tt> declaration.

      While aspects define types that crosscut, the AspectJ system does not
      allow completely arbitrary crosscutting. Rather, aspects define types
      that cut across principled points in a program's execution. These
      principled points are called join points.
    </p><p>
      A join point is a well-defined point in the execution of a
      program. The join points defined by AspectJ are:

          When an object is built and that object's initial constructor is
          called (i.e., not for "super" or "this" constructor calls).  The
          object being constructed is returned at a constructor call join
          point, so its return type is considered to be the type of the
          object, and the object itself may be accessed with <tt>after
          returning</tt> advice.
        </dd><dt><a name="d0e4576"></a><span class="term">Constructor execution</span></dt><dd>
          When the body of code for an actual constructor executes, after
          its this or super constructor call.  The object being constructed
          is the currently executing object, and so may be accessed with
          the <tt>this</tt> pointcut.  The constructor execution
          join point for a constructor that calls a super constructor also
          includes any non-static initializers of enclosing class.  No
          value is returned from a constructor execution join point, so its
          return type is considered to be void.

          When the static initializer for a class executes.  No value is

         Before the object initialization code for a particular class runs.
         This encompasses the time between the start of its first called
         constructor and the start of its parent's constructor.  Thus, the
         execution of these join points encompass the join points of the
         evaluation of the arguments of <tt>this()</tt> and
         <tt>super()</tt> constructor calls.  No value is
         returned from an object pre-initialization join point, so its
         return type is considered to be void.
       </dd><dt><a name="d0e4600"></a><span class="term">Object initialization</span></dt><dd>
          When the object initialization code for a particular class runs.
          This encompasses the time between the return of its parent's
          constructor and the return of its first called constructor. It
          includes all the dynamic initializers and constructors used to
          create the object.  The object being constructed is the currently
          executing object, and so may be accessed with the
          <tt>this</tt> pointcut.  No value is returned from a

          considered to be void.

          When a non-constant field is referenced.  [Note that references
          to constant fields (static final fields bound to a constant

          No value is returned from a field set join point, so
          its return type is considered to be void.
          [Note that the initializations of constant fields (static
          final fields where the initializer is a constant string object or

      Each join point potentially has three pieces of state associated
      with it: the currently executing object, the target object, and
      an object array of arguments.  These are exposed by the three
      state-exposing pointcuts, <tt>this</tt>,

      Informally, the currently executing object is the object that a

      point.  The target object is where control or attention is
      transferred to by the join point.  The arguments are those
      values passed for that transfer of control or attention.

      A pointcut is a program element that picks out join points and

      Pointcuts are used primarily by advice.  They can be composed with
      boolean operators to build up other pointcuts.  The primitive

        Pointcuts are defined and named by the programmer with the

</pre><p>
        A named pointcut may be defined in either a class or aspect, and is
        treated as a member of the class or aspect where it is found.  As a
        member, it may have an access modifier such as
        <tt>public</tt> or <tt>private</tt>.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

        Pointcuts that are not final may be declared abstract, and defined
        without a body.  Abstract pointcuts may only be declared within
        abstract aspects.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

      abstract pointcut publicCall(int i);

        In such a case, an extending aspect may override the abstract

        For completeness, a pointcut with a declaration may be declared
        <tt>final</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Though named pointcut declarations appear somewhat like method
        declarations, and can be overridden in subaspects, they cannot be
        overloaded. It is an error for two pointcuts to be named with the
        same name in the same class or aspect declaration.
      </p><p>
        The scope of a named pointcut is the enclosing class declaration.
        This is different than the scope of other members; the scope of
        other members is the enclosing class <span class="emphasis"><i>body</i></span>.
        This means that the following code is legal:

        Pointcuts have an interface; they expose some parts of the
        execution context of the join points they pick out. For example,
        the PublicIntCall above exposes the first argument from the
        receptions of all public unary integer methods.  This context is
        exposed by providing typed formal parameters to named pointcuts and
        advice, like the formal parameters of a Java method. These formal
        parameters are bound by name matching.
      </p><p>
        On the right-hand side of advice or pointcut declarations, in
        certain pointcut designators, a Java identifier is allowed in place
        of a type or collection of types.  The pointcut designators that
        allow this are <tt>this</tt>, <tt>target</tt>,
        and <tt>args</tt>.  In all such cases, using an
        identifier rather than a type does two things.  First, it selects
        join points as based on the type of the formal parameter.  So the
        pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut intArg(int i): args(i);
</pre><p>
        picks out join points where an <tt>int</tt> (or
        a <tt>byte</tt>, <tt>short</tt>, or
        <tt>char</tt>; anything assignable to an
        <tt>int</tt>) is being passed as an argument.
        Second, though, it makes the value of that argument
        available to the enclosing advice or pointcut.  
      </p><p>
        Values can be exposed from named pointcuts as well, so
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut publicCall(int x): call(public *.*(int)) &amp;&amp; intArg(x);
  pointcut intArg(int i): args(i);
</pre><p>
        is a legal way to pick out all calls to public methods accepting an
        int argument, and exposing that argument.
      </p><p>
        There is one special case for this kind of exposure.  Exposing an
        argument of type Object will also match primitive typed arguments,
        and expose a "boxed" version of the primitive.  So,
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut publicCall(): call(public *.*(..)) &amp;&amp; args(Object);
</pre><p>
        will pick out all unary methods that take, as their only argument,
        subtypes of Object (i.e., not primitive types like
        <tt>int</tt>), but
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut publicCall(Object o): call(public *.*(..)) &amp;&amp; args(o);
</pre><p>
        will pick out all unary methods that take any argument: And if the
        argument was an <tt>int</tt>, then the value passed to
        advice will be of type <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt>.
      </p><p>
        The "boxing" of the primitive value is based on the
        <span class="emphasis"><i>original</i></span> primitive type.  So in the
        following program
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  public class InstanceOf {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      doInt(5);
    }

    static void doInt(int i) {  }
  }

  aspect IntToLong {
    pointcut el(long l) : 
        execution(* doInt(..)) &amp;&amp; args(l);

    before(Object o) : el(o) {
         System.out.println(o.getClass());
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        The pointcut will match and expose the integer argument,
        but it will expose it as an <tt>Integer</tt>,
        not a <tt>Long</tt>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="primitive-pointcuts"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="primitive-pointcuts"></a>Primitive pointcuts</h3></div></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5230"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5230"></a>Method-related pointcuts</h4></div></div><p>AspectJ provides two primitive pointcut designators designed to

          Many concerns cut across the dynamic times when an object of a
          particular type is executing, being operated on, or being passed
          around.  AspectJ provides primitive pointcuts that capture join
          points at these times.  These pointcuts use the dynamic types of
          their objects to pick out join points.  They may also be used to
          expose the objects used for discrimination.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e5356"></a><tt>this(<i><tt>Type</tt></i> or <i><tt>Id</tt></i>)</tt></li><li><a name="d0e5365"></a><tt>target(<i><tt>Type</tt></i> or <i><tt>Id</tt></i>)</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          The <tt>this</tt> pointcut picks out each join point where
          the currently executing object (the object bound to
          <tt>this</tt>) is an instance of a particular type.  The
          <tt>target</tt> pointcut picks out each join point where
          the target object (the object on which a method is called or a field
          is accessed) is an instance of a particular type.  Note that
          <tt>target</tt> should be understood to be the object the
          current join point is transfering control to.  This means that the
          target object is the same as the current object at a method execution
          join point, for example, but may be different at a method call join
          point.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e5389"></a><tt>args(<i><tt>Type</tt></i> or <i><tt>Id</tt></i> or "..", ...)</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          The args pointcut picks out each join point where the arguments are
          instances of some types.  Each element in the comma-separated list is
          one of four things.  If it is a type name, then the argument in that
          position must be an instance of that type. If it is an identifier,
          then that identifier must be bound in the enclosing advice or
          pointcut declaration, and so the argument in that position must be an
          instance of the type of the identifier (or of any type if the
          identifier is typed to Object).  If it is the "*" wildcard, then any
          argument will match, and if it is the special wildcard "..", then any
          number of arguments will match, just like in signature patterns.  So the
          pointcut
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  args(int, .., String)
</pre><p>
          will pick out all join points where the first argument is an
          <tt>int</tt> and the last is a <tt>String</tt>.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5410"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5410"></a>Control flow-based pointcuts</h4></div></div><p>
          Some concerns cut across the control flow of the program. The
          <tt>cflow</tt> and <tt>cflowbelow</tt> primitive
          pointcut designators capture join points based on control flow.

          While many concerns cut across the runtime structure of the program,
          some must deal with the lexical structure. AspectJ allows aspects to

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e5518"></a><tt>within(<i><tt>TypePattern</tt></i>)</tt></li><li><a name="d0e5524"></a><tt>withincode(<i><tt>MethodPattern</tt></i>)</tt></li><li><a name="d0e5530"></a><tt>withincode(<i><tt>ConstructorPattern</tt></i>)</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          The <tt>within</tt> pointcut picks out each join point
          where the code executing is defined in the declaration of one of the
          types in <i><tt>TypePattern</tt></i>. This includes the
          class initialization, object initialization, and method and
          constructor execution join points for the type, as well as any join
          points associated with the statements and expressions of the type.
          It also includes any join points that are associated with code in a
          type's nested types, and that type's default constructor, if there is
          one.

          The <tt>withincode</tt> pointcuts picks out each join point

          constructor execution join point as well as any join points
          associated with the statements and expressions of the method or
          constructor.  It also includes any join points that are associated
          with code in a method or constructor's local or anonymous types.

          The if pointcut picks out join points based on a dynamic property.
          its syntax takes an expression, which must evaluate to a boolean
          true or false.  Within this expression, the
          <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> object is available.  So one
          (extremely inefficient) way of picking out all call join points would

	    	Note that the order of evaluation for pointcut expression

        One very important property of a join point is its signature, which is
        used by many of AspectJ's pointcut designators to select particular
        join points.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5576"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5576"></a>Methods</h4></div></div><p>
          Join points associated with methods typically have method signatures,
          consisting of a method name, parameter types, return type, the types of
          the declared (checked) exceptions, and some type that the method could
          be called on (below called the "qualifying type").
        </p><p>
          At a method call join point, the signature is a method signature whose
          qualifying type is the static type used to <span class="emphasis"><i>access</i></span>
          the method.  This means that the signature for the join point created
          from the call <tt>((Integer)i).toString()</tt> is different
          than that for the call <tt>((Object)i).toString()</tt>, even
          if <tt>i</tt> is the same variable.
        </p><p>
          At a method execution join point, the signature is a method signature
          whose qualifying type is the declaring type of the method.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5597"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5597"></a>Fields</h4></div></div><p>
          Join points associated with fields typically have field signatures,
          consisting of a field name and a field type.  A field reference join
          point has such a signature, and no parameters.  A field set join point
          has such a signature, but has a has a single parameter whose type is
          the same as the field type.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5602"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5602"></a>Constructors</h4></div></div><p>
          Join points associated with constructors typically have constructor
          signatures, consisting of a parameter types, the types of the declared
          (checked) exceptions, and the declaring type.
        </p><p>
          At a constructor call join point, the signature is the constructor
          signature of the called constructor.  At a constructor execution join
          point, the signature is the constructor signature of the currently
          executing constructor.
        </p><p>
          At object initialization and pre-initialization join points, the
          signature is the constructor signature for the constructor that started
          this initialization: the first constructor entered during this type's
          initialization of this object.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5611"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5611"></a>Others</h4></div></div><p>
          At a handler execution join point, the signature is composed of the
          exception type that the handler handles.
        </p><p>
          At an advice execution join point, the signature is composed of the
          aspect type, the parameter types of the advice, the return type (void
          for all but around advice) and the types of the declared (checked)
          exceptions.
        </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="matching"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="matching"></a>Matching</h3></div></div><p>
        The <tt>withincode</tt>, <tt>call</tt>,
        <tt>execution</tt>, <tt>get</tt>, and
        <tt>set</tt> primitive pointcut designators all use signature
        patterns to determine the join points they describe. A signature
        pattern is an abstract description of one or more join-point
        signatures. Signature patterns are intended to match very closely the
        same kind of things one would write when declaring individual members
        and constructors.
      </p><p>
        Method declarations in Java include method names, method parameters,
        return types, modifiers like static or private, and throws clauses,
        while constructor declarations omit the return type and replace the
        method name with the class name. The start of a particular method
        declaration, in class <tt>Test</tt>, for example, might be
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class C {
      public final void foo() throws ArrayOutOfBoundsException { ... }
  }
</pre><p>
        In AspectJ, method signature patterns have all these, but most elements
        can be replaced by wildcards. So
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(public final void C.foo() throws ArrayOutOfBoundsException)
</pre><p>
        picks out call join points to that method, and the pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(public final void *.*() throws ArrayOutOfBoundsException)
</pre><p>
        picks out all call join points to methods, regardless of their name
        name or which class they are defined on, so long as they take no
        arguments, return no value, are both <tt>public</tt> and
        <tt>final</tt>, and are declared to throw
        <tt>ArrayOutOfBounds</tt> exceptions.
      </p><p>
        The defining type name, if not present, defaults to *, so another way
        of writing that pointcut would be
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(public final void *() throws ArrayOutOfBoundsException)
</pre><p>
        The wildcard <tt>..</tt> indicates zero or more 
        parameters, so
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  execution(void m(..))
</pre><p>
        picks out execution join points for void methods named
        <tt>m</tt>, of any number of arguments, while
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  execution(void m(.., int))
</pre><p>
        picks out execution join points for void methods named
        <tt>m</tt> whose last parameter is of type
        <tt>int</tt>.
      </p><p>
        The modifiers also form part of the signature pattern. If an AspectJ
        signature pattern should match methods without a particular modifier,
        such as all non-public methods, the appropriate modifier should be
        negated with the <tt>!</tt> operator. So,
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  withincode(!public void foo())
</pre><p>
        picks out all join points associated with code in null non-public
        void methods named <tt>foo</tt>, while
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  withincode(void foo())
</pre><p>
        picks out all join points associated with code in null void methods
        named <tt>foo</tt>, regardless of access modifier.
      </p><p>
        Method names may contain the * wildcard, indicating any number of
        characters in the method name.  So
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(int *())
</pre><p>
        picks out all call join points to <tt>int</tt> methods
        regardless of name, but
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(int get*())
</pre><p>
        picks out all call join points to <tt>int</tt> methods
        where the method name starts with the characters "get".
      </p><p>
        AspectJ uses the <tt>new</tt> keyword for constructor
        signature patterns rather than using a particular class name. So the
        execution join points of private null constructor of a class C
        defined to throw an ArithmeticException can be picked out with
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  execution(private C.new() throws ArithmeticException)
</pre><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5733"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5733"></a>Matching based on the declaring type</h4></div></div><p>
        The signature-matching pointcuts all specify a declaring type,
        but the meaning varies slightly for each join point signature,
        in line with Java semantics.
        </p><p>
        When matching for pointcuts <tt>withincode</tt>, 
        <tt>get</tt>, and <tt>set</tt>, the declaring
        type is the class that contains the declaration.
        </p><p>
        When matching method-call join points, the 
        declaring type is the static type used to access the method.
        A common mistake is to specify a declaring type for the 
        <tt>call</tt> pointcut that is a subtype of the 
        originally-declaring type. For example, given the class
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class Service implements Runnable {
    public void run() { ... }
  } 
</pre><p>
        the following pointcut
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(void Service.run())
</pre><p>
        would fail to pick out the join point for the code
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  ((Runnable) new Service()).run();
</pre><p>
        Specifying the originally-declaring type is correct, but would
        pick out any such call (here, calls to the <tt>run()</tt>
        method of any Runnable).  
        In this situation, consider instead picking out the target type:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(void run()) &amp;&amp; target(Service)
</pre><p>
        When matching method-execution join points, 
        if the execution pointcut method signature specifies a declaring type, 
        the pointcut will only match methods declared in that type, or methods 
        that override methods declared in or inherited by that type.
        So the pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  execution(public void Middle.*())
</pre><p>
      picks out all method executions for public methods returning void
      and having no arguments that are either declared in, or inherited by, 
      Middle, even if those methods are overridden in a subclass of Middle. 
      So the pointcut would pick out the method-execution join point
      for Sub.m() in this code:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class Super {
    protected void m() { ... }
  }
  class Middle extends Super {
  }
  class Sub extends Middle {
    public void m() { ... }
  }
</pre></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5779"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5779"></a>Matching based on the throws clause</h4></div></div><p>
          Type patterns may be used to pick out methods and constructors
          based on their throws clauses. This allows the following two
          kinds of extremely wildcarded pointcuts:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut throwsMathlike():
      // each call to a method with a throws clause containing at least
      // one exception exception with "Math" in its name.
      call(* *(..) throws *..*Math*);

  pointcut doesNotThrowMathlike():
      // each call to a method with a throws clause containing no
      // exceptions with "Math" in its name.
      call(* *(..) throws !*..*Math*);
</pre><p>
          A <i><tt>ThrowsClausePattern</tt></i> is a comma-separated list of
          <i><tt>ThrowsClausePatternItem</tt></i>s, where

          <div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><a name="d0e5795"></a><span class="term"><i><tt>ThrowsClausePatternItem</tt></i> :</span></dt><dd><tt>[ ! ]
                <i><tt>TypeNamePattern</tt></i></tt></dd></dl></div>
        </p><p>
          A <i><tt>ThrowsClausePattern</tt></i> matches the
          throws clause of any code member signature. To match, each
          <tt>ThrowsClausePatternItem</tt> must
          match the throws clause of the member in question. If any item
          doesn't match, then the whole pattern doesn't match.
        </p><p>
          If a ThrowsClausePatternItem begins with "!", then it matches a
          particular throws clause if and only if <span class="emphasis"><i>none</i></span>
          of the types named in the throws clause is matched by the
          <tt>TypeNamePattern</tt>.
        </p><p>
          If a <i><tt>ThrowsClausePatternItem</tt></i> does not
          begin with "!", then it matches a throws clause if and only if
          <span class="emphasis"><i>any</i></span> of the types named in the throws clause
          is matched by the <span class="emphasis"><i>TypeNamePattern</i></span>.
        </p><p>
          The rule for "!" matching has one potentially surprising
          property, in that these two pointcuts

          <div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e5836"></a> call(* *(..) throws !IOException) </li><li><a name="d0e5838"></a> call(* *(..) throws (!IOException)) </li></ul></div>

          will match differently on calls to

          <blockquote class="blockquote"><tt>
              void m() throws RuntimeException, IOException {}
            </tt></blockquote>
        </p><p>
          [1] will NOT match the method m(), because method m's throws
          clause declares that it throws IOException. [2] WILL match the
          method m(), because method m's throws clause declares the it
          throws some exception which does not match IOException,
          i.e. RuntimeException.
        </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="type-patterns"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="type-patterns"></a>Type patterns</h3></div></div><p>
        Type patterns are a way to pick out collections of types and use them
        in places where you would otherwise use only one type.  The rules for
        using type patterns are simple.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5852"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5852"></a>Exact type pattern</h4></div></div><p>
          First, all type names are also type patterns.  So
          <tt>Object</tt>, <tt>java.util.HashMap</tt>,
          <tt>Map.Entry</tt>, <tt>int</tt> are all type
          patterns.
        </p><p>
	  If a type pattern is an exact type - if it doesn't
	  include a wildcard - then the matching works just
	  like normal type lookup in Java: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e5872"></a>Patterns that have the same names as
          primitive types (like <tt>int</tt>) match
          those primitive types.</li><li><a name="d0e5877"></a>Patterns that are qualified by package names
          (like <tt>java.util.HashMap</tt>) match types
          in other packages.
          </li><li><a name="d0e5882"></a>Patterns that are not qualified (like
          <tt>HashMap</tt>) match types that are
          resolved by Java's normal scope rules.  So, for
          example, <tt>HashMap</tt> might match a
          package-level type in the same package or a type that
          have been imported with java's
          <tt>import</tt> form.  But it would not match
          <tt>java.util.HashMap</tt> unless the aspect
          were in <tt>java.util</tt> or the type had
          been imported.
          </li></ul></div><p>
	  So exact type patterns match based on usual Java scope
	  rules.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5901"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5901"></a>Type name patterns</h4></div></div><p>
          There is a special type name, *, which is also a type pattern.  * picks out all
          types, including primitive types.  So
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(void foo(*))
</pre><p>
          picks out all call join points to void methods named foo, taking one
          argument of any type.
        </p><p>
          Type names that contain the two wildcards "*" and
          "<tt>..</tt>" are also type patterns.  The * wildcard matches
          zero or more characters characters except for ".", so it can be used
          when types have a certain naming convention.  So
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  handler(java.util.*Map)
</pre><p>
          picks out the types java.util.Map and java.util.java.util.HashMap,
          among others, and
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  handler(java.util.*)
</pre><p>
          picks out all types that start with "<tt>java.util.</tt>" and
          don't have any more "."s, that is, the types in the
          <tt>java.util</tt> package, but not inner types
          (such as java.util.Map.Entry).
        </p><p>
          The "<tt>..</tt>" wildcard matches any sequence of
          characters that start and end with a ".", so it can be used
          to pick out all types in any subpackage, or all inner types.  So
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  within(com.xerox..*)
</pre><p>
          picks out all join points where the code is in any 
          declaration of a type whose name begins with "<tt>com.xerox.</tt>".
        </p><p>
	  Type patterns with wildcards do not depend on Java's
	  usual scope rules - they match against all types
	  available to the weaver, not just those that are
	  imported into an Aspect's declaring file.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5943"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5943"></a>Subtype patterns</h4></div></div><p>
          It is possible to pick out all subtypes of a type (or a collection of
          types) with the "+" wildcard.  The "+" wildcard follows immediately a
          type name pattern.  So, while
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(Foo.new())
</pre><p>
          picks out all constructor call join points where an instance of exactly
          type Foo is constructed,
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(Foo+.new())
</pre><p>
          picks out all constructor call join points where an instance of any
          subtype of Foo (including Foo itself) is constructed, and the unlikely
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  call(*Handler+.new())
</pre><p>
          picks out all constructor call join points where an instance of any
          subtype of any type whose name ends in "Handler" is constructed.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5960"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5960"></a>Array type patterns</h4></div></div><p>
          A type name pattern or subtype pattern can be followed by one or more
          sets of square brackets to make array type patterns.  So
          <tt>Object[]</tt> is an array type pattern, and so is
          <tt>com.xerox..*[][]</tt>, and so is
          <tt>Object+[]</tt>.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e5974"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e5974"></a>Type patterns</h4></div></div><p>
          Type patterns are built up out of type name patterns, subtype patterns,
          and array type patterns, and constructed with boolean operators
          <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, <tt>||</tt>, and
          <tt>!</tt>.  So
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  staticinitialization(Foo || Bar)

          picks out the static initializer execution join points of either Foo or Bar,
          and

  call((Foo+ &amp;&amp; ! Foo).new(..))

        <i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i> {

      where <i><tt>AdviceSpec</tt></i> is one of

      and where <i><tt>Formal</tt></i> refers to a
        variable binding like those used for method parameters,
        of the form 
        <tt><i><tt>Type</tt></i></tt>
        <tt><i><tt>Variable-Name</tt></i></tt>,
        and <i><tt>Formals</tt></i> refers to a comma-delimited
        list of <i><tt>Formal</tt></i>.
    </p><p>
      Advice defines crosscutting behavior.  It is defined in terms of
      pointcuts. The code of a piece of advice runs at every join point
      picked out by its pointcut. Exactly how the code runs depends on the
      kind of advice.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ supports three kinds of advice. The kind of advice determines how
      it interacts with the join points it is defined over. Thus AspectJ
      divides advice into that which runs before its join points, that which
      runs after its join points, and that which runs in place of (or "around")
      its join points.
    </p><p>
      While before advice is relatively unproblematic, there can be three
      interpretations of after advice: After the execution of a join point
      completes normally, after it throws an exception, or after it does either
      one. AspectJ allows after advice for any of these situations.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      pointcut publicCall(): call(public Object *(..));
      after() returning (Object o): publicCall() {
	  System.out.println("Returned normally with " + o);
      }
      after() throwing (Exception e): publicCall() {
	  System.out.println("Threw an exception: " + e);
      }
      after(): publicCall(){
	  System.out.println("Returned or threw an Exception");
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      After returning advice may not care about its returned object, in which
      case it may be written
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  after() returning: call(public Object *(..)) {
      System.out.println("Returned normally");
  }
</pre><p>
      If after returning does expose its returned object, then the
      type of the parameter is considered to be an
      <tt>instanceof</tt>-like constraint on the advice:  it
      will run only when the return value is of the appropriate type.
    </p><p>
      A value is of the appropriate type if it would be assignable to
      a variable of that type, in the Java sense.  That is, a
      <tt>byte</tt> value is assignable to a
      <tt>short</tt> parameter but not vice-versa, an
      <tt>int</tt> is assignable to a
      <tt>float</tt> parameter, <tt>boolean</tt>
      values are only assignable to <tt>boolean</tt>
      parameters, and reference types work by instanceof.
    </p><p>
      There are two special cases: If the exposed value is typed to
      <tt>Object</tt>, then the advice is not constrained by
      that type: the actual return value is converted to an object
      type for the body of the advice: <tt>int</tt> values
      are represented as <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt> objects,
      etc, and no value (from void methods, for example) is
      represented as <tt>null</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Secondly, the <tt>null</tt> value is assignable to a
      parameter <tt>T</tt> if the join point
      <span class="emphasis"><i>could</i></span> return something of type
      <tt>T</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Around advice runs in place of the join point it operates over, rather
      than before or after it.  Because around is allowed to return a value, it
      must be declared with a return type, like a method.
    </p><p>
      Thus, a simple use of around advice is to make a particular method
      constant:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      int around(): call(int C.foo()) {
	  return 3;
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      Within the body of around advice, though, the computation of the original
      join point can be executed with the special syntax
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  proceed( ... )
</pre><p>
      The proceed form takes as arguments the context exposed by the around's
      pointcut, and returns whatever the around is declared to return. So the
      following around advice will double the second argument to
      <tt>foo</tt> whenever it is called, and then halve its result:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      int around(int i): call(int C.foo(Object, int)) &amp;&amp; args(i) {
	  int newi = proceed(i*2)
	  return newi/2;
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      If the return value of around advice is typed to
      <tt>Object</tt>, then the result of proceed is converted to an
      object representation, even if it is originally a primitive value.  And
      when the advice returns an Object value, that value is converted back to
      whatever representation it was originally.  So another way to write the
      doubling and halving advice is:

      In all kinds of advice, the parameters of the advice behave exactly like
      method parameters.  In particular, assigning to any parameter affects
      only the value of the parameter, not the value that it came from.  This
      means that
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      after() returning (int i): call(int C.foo()) {
	  i = i * 2;
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      will <span class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> double the returned value of the advice.
      Rather, it will double the local parameter.  Changing the values of
      parameters or return values of join points can be done by using around
      advice.
    </p><p>
        With <tt>proceed(..)</tt> it is possible to change the values
        used by less-precedent advice and the underlying join point by supplying
        different values for the variables.  For example, this aspect replaces
        the string bound to <tt>s</tt> in the named pointcut 
        <tt>privateData</tt>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
    Object around(String s): MyPointcuts.privateData(s) {
      return proceed("private data");
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        If you replace an argument to <tt>proceed(..)</tt>, you can cause 
        a <tt>ClassCastException</tt> at runtime when the argument
        refers to a supertype of the actual type and you do not supply a 
        reference of the actual type.  In the following aspect, the
        around advice replaces the declared target <tt>List</tt> 
        with an <tt>ArrayList</tt>.  This is valid code at
        compile-time since the types match.  
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  import java.util.*;

  aspect A {
    Object around(List list): call(* List+.*()) &amp;&amp; target(list) {
      return proceed(new ArrayList());
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        But imagine a simple program where the actual target is
        <tt>LinkedList</tt>.  In this case, the advice would cause a
        <tt>ClassCastException</tt> at runtime, and 
        <tt>peek()</tt> is not declared in <tt>ArrayList</tt>.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      new LinkedList().peek();
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        The <tt>ClassCastException</tt> can occur even in situations
        where it appears to be unnecessary, e.g., if the program is changed to
        call <tt>size()</tt>, declared in <tt>List</tt>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      new LinkedList().size();
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        There will still be a <tt>ClassCastException</tt> because
        it is impossible to prove that there won't be a runtime binary-compatible
        change in the hierarchy of <tt>LinkedList</tt> or some

        The <tt>strictfp</tt> modifier is the only modifier allowed

        checked exceptions must be compatible with each target join point
        of the advice, or an error is signalled by the compiler.
      </p><p>
        For example, in the following declarations:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

        Three special variables are visible within bodies of advice

        an object that encapsulates some of the context of the advice's current
        or enclosing join point.  These variables exist because some pointcuts
        may pick out very large collections of join points. For example, the
        pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut publicCall(): call(public * *(..));
</pre><p>
        picks out calls to many methods. Yet the body of advice over this

        particular join point.
      </p><p>
        <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> is bound to a complete join point
        object.

      </p><p>
        <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt> is bound to a part of the
        join point object that includes less information, but for which no
        memory allocation is required on each execution of the advice.  It is
        equivalent to <tt>thisJoinPoint.getStaticPart()</tt>.
      </p><p>
        <tt>thisEnclosingJoinPointStaticPart</tt> is bound to the

        the static part of this enclosing join point is available through this
        mechanism.
      </p><p>
        Standard Java reflection uses objects from the
        <tt>java.lang.reflect</tt> hierarchy to build up its
        reflective objects.  Similarly, AspectJ join point objects have types
        in a type hierarchy.  The type of objects bound to
        <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> is
        <tt>org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint</tt>, while
        <tt>thisStaticJoinPoint</tt> is bound to objects of interface

      Advice declarations change the behavior of classes they crosscut, but do
      not change their static type structure. For crosscutting concerns that do
      operate over the static structure of type hierarchies, AspectJ provides
      inter-type member declarations and other <tt>declare</tt> forms.
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="inter-type-member-declarations"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inter-type-member-declarations"></a>Inter-type member declarations</h3></div></div><p>
          AspectJ allows the declaration of members by aspects that are
          associated with other types.
        </p><p>
        An inter-type method declaration looks like
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e6487"></a><tt>
        [ <i><tt>Modifiers</tt></i> ]
        <i><tt>Type</tt></i> <i><tt>OnType</tt></i>
        .
        <i><tt>Id</tt></i>(<i><tt>Formals</tt></i>)
        [ <i><tt>ThrowsClause</tt></i> ]
        { <i><tt>Body</tt></i> }</tt></li><li><a name="d0e6511"></a><tt>abstract
        [ <i><tt>Modifiers</tt></i> ]
        <i><tt>Type</tt></i> <i><tt>OnType</tt></i>
        .  <i><tt>Id</tt></i>(<i><tt>Formals</tt></i>)
        [ <i><tt>ThrowsClause</tt></i> ]
        ;
        </tt></li></ul></div><p>
        The effect of such a declaration is to make <i><tt>OnType</tt></i>
        support the new method.  Even if <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> is
        an interface.  Even if the method is neither public nor abstract.  So the
        following is legal AspectJ code:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  interface Iface {}

  aspect A {
      private void Iface.m() {
	  System.err.println("I'm a private method on an interface");
      }
      void worksOnI(Iface iface) {
	  // calling a private method on an interface
	  iface.m();
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        An inter-type constructor declaration looks like
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e6545"></a><tt>
        [ <i><tt>Modifiers</tt></i> ]
        <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> . new (
        <i><tt>Formals</tt></i> )
        [ <i><tt>ThrowsClause</tt></i> ]
        { <i><tt>Body</tt></i> }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
        The effect of such a declaration is to make
        <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> support the new constructor.  It is
        an error for <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> to be an interface.
      </p><p>
	    Inter-type declared constructors cannot be used to assign a
	    value to a final variable declared in <i><tt>OnType</tt></i>.
	    This limitation significantly increases the ability to both understand
	    and compile the <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> class and the
	    declaring aspect separately.
	  </p><p>
        Note that in the Java language, classes that define no constructors
        have an implicit no-argument constructor that just calls
        <tt>super()</tt>.  This means that attempting to declare
        a no-argument inter-type constructor on such a class may result in
        a conflict, even though it <span class="emphasis"><i>looks</i></span> like no
        constructor is defined.
      </p><p>
        An inter-type field declaration looks like one of
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e6590"></a><tt>
        [ <i><tt>Modifiers</tt></i> ]
        <i><tt>Type</tt></i>
        <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> . <i><tt>Id</tt></i>
        = <i><tt>Expression</tt></i>;</tt></li><li><a name="d0e6608"></a><tt>
        [ <i><tt>Modifiers</tt></i> ]
        <i><tt>Type</tt></i>
        <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> . <i><tt>Id</tt></i>;</tt></li></ul></div><p>
        The effect of such a declaration is to make
        <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> support the new field. Even if
        <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> is an interface. Even if the field is
        neither public, nor static, nor final.
      </p><p>
        The initializer, if any, of an inter-type field declaration runs
        before the class-local initializers defined in its target class.
      </p></div><p>
        Any occurrence of the identifier <tt>this</tt> in the body of
        an inter-type constructor or method declaration, or in the initializer
        of an inter-type field declaration, refers to the
        <i><tt>OnType</tt></i> object rather than to the aspect
        type; it is an error to access <tt>this</tt> in such a
        position from a <tt>static</tt> inter-type member
        declaration.
      </p><div class="sect2"><a name="access-modifiers"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="access-modifiers"></a>Access modifiers</h3></div></div><p>
        Inter-type member declarations may be public or private, or have
        default (package-protected) visibility.  AspectJ does not provide
        protected inter-type members.
      </p><p>
        The access modifier applies in relation to the aspect, not in relation
        to the target type. So a private inter-type member is visible only from
        code that is defined within the declaring aspect. A default-visibility
        inter-type member is visible only from code that is defined within the
        declaring aspect's package.
      </p><p>
        Note that a declaring a private inter-type method (which AspectJ
        supports) is very different from inserting a private method declaration
        into another class.  The former allows access only from the declaring
        aspect, while the latter would allow access only from the target type.
        Java serialization, for example, uses the presense of a private method
        <tt>void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream)</tt> for the
        implementation of <tt>java.io.Serializable</tt>.  A private
        inter-type declaration of that method would not fulfill this
        requirement, since it would be private to the aspect, not private to
        the target type.
      </p><p>
        The access modifier of abstract inter-type methods has
        one constraint: It is illegal to declare an abstract
        non-public inter-type method on a public interface.  This
        is illegal because it would say that a public interface
        has a constraint that only non-public implementors must
        fulfill.  This would not be compatible with Java's type
        system.  
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="conflicts"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="conflicts"></a>Conflicts</h3></div></div><p>
        Inter-type declarations raise the possibility of conflicts among
        locally declared members and inter-type members.  For example, assuming
        <tt>otherPackage</tt> is not the package containing the
        aspect <tt>A</tt>, the code
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      private Registry otherPackage.onType.r;
      public void otherPackage.onType.register(Registry r) {
	    r.register(this);
	    this.r = r;
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        declares that <tt>onType</tt> in <tt>otherPackage</tt> has a field
        <tt>r</tt>.  This field, however, is only accessible from the
        code inside of aspect <tt>A</tt>.  The aspect also declares
        that <tt>onType</tt> has a method
        "<tt>register</tt>", but makes this method accessible from
        everywhere.
      </p><p>
        If <tt>onType</tt> already defines a
        private or package-protected field "<tt>r</tt>", there is no
        conflict: The aspect cannot see such a field, and no code in
        <tt>otherPackage</tt> can see the inter-type
        "<tt>r</tt>".
      </p><p>
        If <tt>onType</tt> defines a public field
        "<tt>r</tt>", there is a conflict: The expression
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  this.r = r
</pre><p>
        is an error, since it is ambiguous whether the private inter-type
        "<tt>r</tt>" or the public locally-defined
        "<tt>r</tt>" should be used.
      </p><p>
        If <tt>onType</tt> defines a method
        "<tt>register(Registry)</tt>" there is a conflict, since it
        would be ambiguous to any code that could see such a defined method
        which "<tt>register(Registry)</tt>" method was applicable.
      </p><p>
        Conflicts are resolved as much as possible as per Java's conflict

        Given a potential conflict between inter-type member declarations in
        different aspects, if one aspect has precedence over the other its
        declaration will take effect without any conflict notice from compiler.
        This is true both when the precedence is declared explicitly with
        <tt>declare precedence</tt> as well as when when sub-aspects
        implicitly have precedence over their super-aspect.

        An aspect may change the inheritance hierarchy of a system by changing
        the superclass of a type or adding a superinterface onto a type, with
        the <tt>declare parents</tt> form.

        For example, if an aspect wished to make a particular class runnable,
        it might define appropriate inter-type <tt>void
        run()</tt> method, but it should also declare that the class
        fulfills the <tt>Runnable</tt> interface.  In order to
        implement the methods in the <tt>Runnable</tt> interface, the
        inter-type <tt>run()</tt> method must be public:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      declare parents: SomeClass implements Runnable;
      public void SomeClass.run() { ... }

        Through the use of inter-type members, interfaces may now carry
        (non-public-static-final) fields and (non-public-abstract) methods that
        classes can inherit. Conflicts may occur from ambiguously inheriting
        members from a superclass and multiple superinterfaces.
      </p><p>
        Because interfaces may carry non-static initializers, each interface
        behaves as if it has a zero-argument constructor containing its
        initializers.  The order of super-interface instantiation is
        observable. We fix this order with the following properties: A
        supertype is initialized before a subtype, initialized code runs only
        once, and the initializers for a type's superclass are run before the
        initializers for its superinterfaces.  Consider the following hierarchy
        where {<tt>Object</tt>, <tt>C</tt>,
        <tt>D</tt>, <tt>E</tt>} are classes,
        {<tt>M</tt>, <tt>N</tt>, <tt>O</tt>,

        An aspect may declare a precedence relationship between concrete
        aspects with the <tt>declare precedence</tt> form:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e6932"></a><tt>declare precedence :

      concrete aspects matched by some pattern in
      <i><tt>TypePatternList</tt></i>, then the precedence of
      the advice will be the order of in the list.  </p><p>In <i><tt>TypePatternList</tt></i>, the wildcard "*" can
      appear at most once, and it means "any type not matched by any other
      pattern in the list". </p><p>For example, the constraints that (1) aspects that have
      Security as part of their name should have precedence over all other
      aspects, and (2) the Logging aspect (and any aspect that extends it)
      should have precedence over all non-security aspects, can be
      expressed by:</p><pre class="programlisting">
  declare precedence: *..*Security*, Logging+, *;
</pre><p>
        For another example, the CountEntry aspect might want to count the
        entry to methods in the current package accepting a Type object as
        its first argument.  However, it should count all entries, even
        those that the aspect DisallowNulls causes to throw exceptions.
        This can be accomplished by stating that CountEntry has precedence
        over DisallowNulls.  This declaration could be in either aspect, or
        in another, ordering aspect:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect Ordering {
      declare precedence: CountEntry, DisallowNulls;
  }
  aspect DisallowNulls {
      pointcut allTypeMethods(Type obj): call(* *(..)) &amp;&amp; args(obj, ..);
      before(Type obj):  allTypeMethods(obj) {
	  if (obj == null) throw new RuntimeException();
      }
  }
  aspect CountEntry {
      pointcut allTypeMethods(Type obj): call(* *(..)) &amp;&amp; args(obj, ..);
      static int count = 0;
      before():  allTypeMethods(Type) {
	  count++;
      }
  }
</pre><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e6956"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e6956"></a>Various cycles</h4></div></div><p>
          It is an error for any aspect to be matched by more than one
          TypePattern in a single decare precedence, so:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  declare precedence:  A, B, A ;  // error
</pre><p>
          However, multiple declare precedence forms may legally have this
          kind of circularity. For example, each of these declare
          precedence is perfectly legal:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  declare precedence: B, A;
  declare precedence: A, B;
</pre><p>
          And a system in which both constraints are active may also be
          legal, so long as advice from A and B don't share a join
          point. So this is an idiom that can be used to enforce that A and
          B are strongly independent.

          Consider the following library aspects:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
  abstract aspect Logging {
      abstract pointcut logged();

      before(): logged() {

      Object around(): profiled() {
          long beforeTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
          try {

          } finally {

  }
</pre><p>
          In order to use either aspect, they must be extended with
          concrete aspects, say, MyLogging and MyProfiling. Because advice
          only applies from concrete aspects, the declare precedence form
          only matters when declaring precedence with concrete aspects.  So
        </p><pre class="programlisting">

          has no effect, but both

        The <tt>aspect</tt> declaration is similar to the

        To support abstraction and composition of crosscutting concerns,

          An aspect, abstract or concrete, may extend a class and may implement
          a set of interfaces. Extending a class does not provide the ability
          to instantiate the aspect with a new expression: The aspect may still
          only define a null constructor.
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7060"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7060"></a>Classes may not extend aspects</h4></div></div><p>

        </h4></div></div><p>
          Aspects may extend other aspects, in which case not only are fields
          and methods inherited but so are pointcuts. However, aspects may only
          extend abstract aspects. It is an error for a concrete aspect to
          extend another concrete aspect.

        Unlike class expressions, aspects are not instantiated with
        <tt>new</tt> expressions.  Rather, aspect instances are
        automatically created to cut across programs.  A program
          can get a reference to an aspect instance using the static
          method <tt>aspectOf(..)</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Because advice only runs in the context of an aspect instance, aspect
        instantiation indirectly controls when advice runs.
      </p><p>
        The criteria used to determine how an aspect is instantiated
        is inherited from its parent aspect.  If the aspect has no parent
        aspect, then by default the aspect is a singleton aspect.
        How an aspect is instantiated controls the form of the 
        <tt>aspectOf(..)</tt> method defined on the
        concrete aspect class.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7088"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7088"></a>Singleton Aspects</h4></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7092"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> { ... }</tt></li><li><a name="d0e7098"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> issingleton() { ... }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          By default (or by using the modifier <tt>issingleton()</tt>)
          an aspect has exactly one instance that cuts across the entire
          program.  That instance is available at any time during program
          execution from the static method <tt>aspectOf()</tt>
          automatically defined on all concrete aspects
          -- so, in the above examples, <tt>A.aspectOf()</tt> will
          return A's instance.  This aspect instance is created as the aspect's
          classfile is loaded.
        </p><p>
          Because the an instance of the aspect exists at all join points in
          the running of a program (once its class is loaded), its advice will
          have a chance to run at all such join points.
        </p><p>
          (In actuality, one instance of the aspect A is made for each version
          of the aspect A, so there will be one instantiation for each time A
          is loaded by a different classloader.)
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e7119"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e7119"></a>Per-object aspects</h4></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7123"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> perthis(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>) { ... }</tt></li><li><a name="d0e7132"></a><tt>aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> pertarget(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>) { ... }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
          If an aspect A is defined
          <tt>perthis(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>)</tt>, then
          one object of type A is created for every object that is the
          executing object (i.e., "this") at any of the join points picked out
          by <i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>.
          The advice defined in A will run only at a join point where the
          currently executing object has been associated with an instance of
          A.
        </p><p> Similarly, if an aspect A is defined
          <tt>pertarget(<i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i>)</tt>,
          then one object of type A is created for every object that is the
          target object of the join points picked out by

          The advice defined in A will run only at a join point where the
          target object has been associated with an instance of 
		  A.
        </p><p>
          In either case, the static method call
          <tt>A.aspectOf(Object)</tt> can be used to get the aspect
          instance (of type A) registered with the object.  Each aspect
          instance is created as early as possible, but not before reaching a
          join point picked out by <i><tt>Pointcut</tt></i> where
          there is no associated aspect of type A.
        </p><p> Both <tt>perthis</tt> and <tt>pertarget</tt>
        aspects may be affected by code the AspectJ compiler controls, as

          All advice runs in the context of an aspect instance,
          but it is possible to write a piece of advice with a pointcut
          that picks out a join point that must occur before asopect

          The before advice should run before the execution of all
          constructors in the system. It must run in the context of an
          instance of the Watchcall aspect. The only way to get such an
          instance is to have Watchcall's default constructor execute. But
          before that executes, we need to run the before advice...
        </p><p>
          There is no general way to detect these kinds of circularities at
          compile time.  If advice runs before its aspect is instantiated,
          AspectJ will throw a <a href="../api/org/aspectj/lang/NoAspectBoundException.html" target="_top">
          <tt>org.aspectj.lang.NoAspectBoundException</tt></a>.
        </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="aspect-privilege"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aspect-privilege"></a>Aspect privilege</h3></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7243"></a><tt>privileged aspect <i><tt>Id</tt></i> { ... }</tt></li></ul></div><p>
        Code written in aspects is subject to the same access control rules as
        Java code when referring to members of classes or aspects. So, for
        example, code written in an aspect may not refer to members with
        default (package-protected) visibility unless the aspect is defined in
        the same package.
      </p><p>
        While these restrictions are suitable for many aspects, there may be
        some aspects in which advice or inter-type members needs to access private
        or protected resources of other types. To allow this, aspects may be
        declared <tt>privileged</tt>.  Code in priviliged aspects has
        access to all members, even private ones.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class C {
      private int i = 0;
      void incI(int x) { i = i+x; }
  }
  privileged aspect A {
      static final int MAX = 1000;
      before(int x, C c): call(void C.incI(int)) &amp;&amp; target(c) &amp;&amp; args(x) {
	  if (c.i+x &gt; MAX) throw new RuntimeException();
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        In this case, if A had not been declared privileged, the field reference
        c.i would have resulted in an error signaled by the compiler.
      </p><p>
        If a privileged aspect can access multiple versions of a particular
        member, then those that it could see if it were not privileged take
        precedence. For example, in the code
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class C {
      private int i = 0;
      void foo() { }
  }
  privileged aspect A {
      private int C.i = 999;
      before(C c): call(void C.foo()) target(c) {
	  System.out.println(c.i);
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        A's private inter-type field C.i, initially bound to 999, will be
        referenced in the body of the advice in preference to C's privately
        declared field, since the A would have access to its own inter-type
        fields even if it were not privileged.
      </p><p>
        Note that a privileged aspect can access private inter-type
        declarations made by other aspects, since they are simply
        considered private members of that other aspect.

    The initial implementations of AspectJ have all been
    compiler-based implementations.  Certain elements of AspectJ's
    semantics are difficult to implement without making modifications
    to the virtual machine, which a compiler-based implementation
    cannot do.  One way to deal with this problem would be to specify
    only the behavior that is easiest to implement.  We have chosen a
    somewhat different approach, which is to specify an ideal language
    semantics, as well as a clearly defined way in which
    implementations are allowed to deviate from that semantics.  This
    makes it possible to develop conforming AspectJ implementations
    today, while still making it clear what later, and presumably
    better, implementations should do tomorrow.
  </p><p>
    According to the AspectJ language semantics, the declaration
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  before(): get(int Point.x) { System.out.println("got x"); }
</pre><p>
    should advise all accesses of a field of type int and name x from
    instances of type (or subtype of) Point.  It should do this
    regardless of whether all the source code performing the access
    was available at the time the aspect containing this advice was
    compiled, whether changes were made later, etc.
  </p><p>   
    But AspectJ implementations are permitted to deviate from this in
    a well-defined way -- they are permitted to advise only accesses
    in <span class="emphasis"><i>code the implementation controls</i></span>.  Each
    implementation is free within certain bounds to provide its own
    definition of what it means to control code.
  </p><p>
    In the current AspectJ compiler, ajc, control of the code means
    having bytecode for any aspects and all the code they should
    affect available during the compile. This means that if some class
    Client contains code with the expression <tt>new
    Point().x</tt> (which results in a field get join point at
    runtime), the current AspectJ compiler will fail to advise that
    access unless Client.java or Client.class is compiled as well. It
    also means that join points associated with code in native methods
    (including their execution join points) cannot be advised.
  </p><p>
    Different join points have different requirements.  Method and
    constructor call join points can be advised only if ajc controls
    the bytecode for the caller.  Field reference or assignment join
    points can be advised only if ajc controls the bytecode for the
    "caller", the code actually making the reference or assignment.
    Initialization join points can be advised only if ajc controls the
    bytecode of the type being initialized, and execution join points
    can be advised only if ajc controls the bytecode for the method or
    constructor body in question.
  	The end of an exception handler is underdetermined in bytecode,
  	so ajc will not implement after or around advice on handler join 
  	points.
  	Similarly, ajc cannot implement around advice on initialization 
  	or preinitialization join points.  
    In cases where ajc cannot implement advice, it will emit a 
    compile-time error noting this as a compiler limitation.
  </p><p>
    Aspects that are defined <tt>perthis</tt> or
    <tt>pertarget</tt> also have restrictions based on
    control of the code.  In particular, at a join point where the
    bytecode for the currently executing object is not available, an
    aspect defined <tt>perthis</tt> of that join point will
    not be associated.  So aspects defined
    <tt>perthis(Object)</tt> will not create aspect
    instances for every object unless <tt>Object</tt>is part
    of the compile.  Similar restrictions apply to
    <tt>pertarget</tt> aspects.
  </p><p>
    Inter-type declarations such as <tt>declare parents</tt>
    also have restrictions based on control of the code.  If the
    bytecode for the target of an inter-type declaration is not
    available, then the inter-type declaration is not made on that
    target.  So, <tt>declare parents : String implements
    MyInterface</tt> will not work for
    <tt>java.lang.String</tt> unless
    <tt>java.lang.String</tt> is part of the compile.
  </p><p>
  	When declaring members on interfaces, the implementation must
  	control both the interface and the top-level implementors of 
  	that interface (the classes that implement the interface but
  	do not have a superclass that implements the interface).
  	You may weave these separately, but be aware that you will get
  	runtime exceptions if you run the affected top-level classes
  	without the interface as produced by the same ajc implementation.  	
  	Any intertype declaration of an abstract method on an interface 
  	must be specified as public, you will get a compile time error 
  	message indicating this is a compiler limitation if you do not 
  	specify public.  A non-abstract method declared on an interface
  	can use any access modifier except protected.  Note that this is
  	different to normal Java rules where all members declared in 
  	an interface are implicitly public.
  	Finally, note that one cannot define static fields or methods 
  	on interfaces.
  </p><p>
	When declaring methods on target types, only methods declared 
	public are recognizable in the bytecode, so methods must be 
	declared public to be overridden in any subtype or to be called 
	from code in a later compile using the target type as a library.
  </p><p>
    Other AspectJ implementations, indeed, future versions of ajc, may
    define <span class="emphasis"><i>code the implementation controls</i></span> more
    liberally or restrictively, so long as they comport with the Java
	language.  For example, the <tt>call</tt> pointcut does
	not pick out reflective calls to a method implemented in 
	<tt>java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Object, Object[])</tt>.
	Some suggest that the call "happens" and the call pointcut should
	pick it out, but the AspectJ language shouldn't anticipate what happens
	in code outside the control of the implementation, even when it
	is a a well-defined API in a Java standard library.
  </p><p>
    The important thing to remember is that core concepts of AspectJ,
    such as the join point, are unchanged, regardless of which
    implementation is used. During your development, you will have to
    be aware of the limitations of the ajc compiler you're using, but
    these limitations should not drive the design of your aspects.

    </p><p> The java language + operator, when applied to String
    arguments, is implemented in bytecode by calls to

    </p><p> In both of these cases, the current AspectJ compiler
    operates on the bytecode implementation of these language
    features; in short, it operates on what is really happening rather
    than what was written in source code.  This means that there may
    be call join points to <tt>Class.forName</tt> or
    <tt>StringBuffer.append</tt> from programs that do not,
    at first glance, appear to contain such calls:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class Test {
      void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println(Test.class);        // calls Class.forName
          System.out.println(args[0] + args[1]); // calls StringBuffer.append
      }
  }
</pre><p>In short, the join point model of the current AspectJ
    compiler considers these as valid join points.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="the-handler-join-point"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="the-handler-join-point"></a>The Handler join point</h3></div></div><p>The end of exception handlers cannot reliably be found in Java
  bytecode.  Instead of removing the handler join point entirely, the
  current AspectJ compiler restricts what can be done with the handler
  join point:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e7385"></a>After and around advice cannot apply to handler
    join points.</li><li><a name="d0e7387"></a>The control flow of a handler join point cannot be
    detected. </li></ul></div><p>
  The first of these is relatively straightforward.  If any piece of
  after advice (returning, throwing, or "finally") would normally
  apply to a handler join point, it will not in code output by the
  current AspectJ compiler.  A compiler warning is generated whenever
  this is detected to be the case.  Before advice is allowed.
  </p><p> The second is that the control flow of a handler join point
  is not picked out.  For example, the following pointcut
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  cflow(call(void foo()) || handler(java.io.IOException))
</pre><p> will capture all join points in the control flow of a call to
  <tt>void foo()</tt>, but it will <span class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span>
  capture those in the control flow of an
  <tt>IOException</tt> handler.  It is equivalent to
  <tt>cflow(call(void foo()))</tt>.  In general,
  <tt>cflow(handler(<i><tt>Type</tt></i>))</tt>
  will not pick out any join points, the one exception to this is join points
  that occur during the execution of any before advice on the handler.
  </p><p> This does not restrict programs from placing before advice on
  handlers inside <span class="emphasis"><i>other</i></span> control flows.  This
  advice, for example, is perfectly fine:
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  before(): handler(java.io.IOException) &amp;&amp; cflow(void parse()) {
      System.out.println("about to handle an exception while parsing");
  }
</pre><p>
    A source-code implementation of AspectJ (such as AspectJ 1.0.6) is
    able to detect the endpoint of a handler join point, and as such
    will likely have fewer such restrictions.
  </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="initializers-and-inter-type-constructors"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="initializers-and-inter-type-constructors"></a>Initializers and Inter-type Constructors</h3></div></div><p>
    The code for Java initializers, such as the assignment to the
    field d in
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class C {
      double d = Math.sqrt(2);
  }
</pre><p>
    are considered part of constructors by the time AspectJ gets ahold
    of bytecode.  That is, the assignment of d to the square root of
    two happens <span class="emphasis"><i>inside</i></span> the default constructor of
    C.  
  </p><p>
    Thus inter-type constructors will not necessarily run a target
    type's initialization code.  In particular, if the inter-type
    constructor calls a super-constructor (as opposed to a
    <tt>this</tt> constructor), the target type's
    initialization code will <span class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> be run when that
    inter-type constructor is called.
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      C.new(Object o) {} // implicitly calls super()

      public static void main(String[] args) {
         System.out.println((new C()    ).d);    // prints 1.414...
         System.out.println((new C(null)).d);    // prints 0.0
  }
</pre><p>
    It is the job of an inter-type constructor to do all the required
    initialization, or to delegate to a <tt>this</tt>
    constructor if necessary.
