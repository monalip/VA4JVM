      Consider the following Java class:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
class Point {
    private int x, y;

    Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }

    void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }
    void setY(int y) { this.y = y; }

    int getX() { return x; }
    int getY() { return y; }
}
</pre><p>
      In order to get an intuitive understanding of AspectJ's join points
      and pointcuts, let's go back to some of the basic principles of
      Java. Consider the following a method declaration in class Point:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }
</pre><p>
      This piece of program says that when method named
      <tt>setX</tt> with an <tt>int</tt> argument
      called on an object of type <tt>Point</tt>, then the method
      body <tt>{ this.x = x; }</tt> is executed. Similarly, the
      constructor of the class states that when an object of type
      <tt>Point</tt> is instantiated through a constructor with
      two <tt>int</tt> arguments, then the constructor body
      <tt>{ this.x = x; this.y = y; }</tt> is executed.
    </p><p>
      One pattern that emerges from these descriptions is

      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        When something happens, then something gets executed.
      </blockquote>

      In object-oriented programs, there are several kinds of "things that
      happen" that are determined by the language. We call these the join
      points of Java. Join points consist of things like method calls,
      method executions, object instantiations, constructor executions,
      field references and handler executions. (See the <a href="quick.html">AspectJ Quick Reference</a> for a complete listing.)
    </p><p>
      Pointcuts pick out these join points. For example, the pointcut
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut setter(): target(Point) &amp;&amp;
                   (call(void setX(int)) ||
                    call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
      picks out each call to <tt>setX(int)</tt> or
      <tt>setY(int)</tt> when called on an instance of
      <tt>Point</tt>.   Here's another example:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut ioHandler(): within(MyClass) &amp;&amp; handler(IOException);
</pre><p>
      This pointcut picks out each the join point when exceptions of type
      <tt>IOException</tt> are handled inside the code defined by
      class <tt>MyClass</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Pointcut definitions consist of a left-hand side and a right-hand side,
      separated by a colon. The left-hand side consists of the pointcut name
      and the pointcut parameters (i.e. the data available when the events
      happen).  The right-hand side consists of the pointcut itself.

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p><a name="d0e1127"></a>
            It is possible to use wildcards. So

            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1131"></a>
                  <tt>execution(* *(..))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1137"></a>
                  <tt>call(* set(..))</tt>
                </p></li></ol></div>

            means (1) the execution of any method regardless of return or
            parameter types, and (2) the call to any method named
            <tt>set</tt> regardless of return or parameter types
            -- in case of overloading there may be more than one such
            <tt>set</tt> method; this pointcut picks out calls to
            all of them.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1150"></a>
            You can select elements based on types. For example,
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1154"></a>
                  <tt>execution(int *())</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1160"></a>

                  <tt>call(* Point.setY(int))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1172"></a>
                  <tt>call(*.new(int, int))</tt>
                </p></li></ol></div>

            means (1) the execution of any method with no parameters that
            returns an <tt>int</tt>, (2) the call to any
            <tt>setY</tt> method that takes a
            <tt>long</tt> as an argument, regardless of return
            type or declaring type, (3) the call to any of
            <tt>Point</tt>'s <tt>setY</tt> methods that
            take an <tt>int</tt> as an argument, regardless of
            return type, and (4) the call to any classes' constructor, so
            long as it takes exactly two <tt>int</tt>s as
            arguments.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1200"></a>
            You can compose pointcuts. For example,
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1204"></a>
                  <tt>target(Point) &amp;&amp; call(int *())</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1210"></a>
                  <tt>call(* *(..)) &amp;&amp; (within(Line) || within(Point))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1216"></a>
                  <tt>within(*) &amp;&amp; execution(*.new(int))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1222"></a>
                  <tt>
                    !this(Point) &amp;&amp; call(int *(..))
                  </tt>
                </p></li></ol></div>

            means (1) any call to an <tt>int</tt> method with no
            arguments on an instance of <tt>Point</tt>,
            regardless of its name, (2) any call to any method where the
            call is made from the code in <tt>Point</tt>'s or
            <tt>Line</tt>'s type declaration, (3) the execution of
            any constructor taking exactly one <tt>int</tt>
            argument, regardless of where the call is made from, and
            (4) any method call to an <tt>int</tt> method when
            the executing object is any type except <tt>Point</tt>.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1250"></a>
            You can select methods and constructors based on their
            modifiers and on negations of modifiers. For example, you can
            say:
            <div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><a name="d0e1254"></a>
                  <tt>call(public * *(..))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1260"></a>
                  <tt>execution(!static * *(..))</tt>
                </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1266"></a>
                  <tt> execution(public !static * *(..))</tt>
                </p></li></ol></div>
            which means (1) any call to a public method, (2) any
            execution of a non-static method, and (3) any execution of a
            public, non-static method.
          </p></li><li><p><a name="d0e1273"></a>
            Pointcuts can also deal with interfaces. For example, given the
            interface </p><pre class="programlisting">
interface MyInterface { ... }
</pre><p>
            the pointcut <tt>call(* MyInterface.*(..))</tt> picks
            out any call to a method in <tt>MyInterface</tt>'s
            signature -- that is, any method defined by
            <tt>MyInterface</tt> or inherited by one of its a
            supertypes.
          </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect2"><a name="call-vs-execution"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="call-vs-execution"></a>call vs. execution</h3></div></div><p>
        When methods and constructors run, there are two interesting times
        associated with them.  That is when they are called, and when they
        actually execute.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ exposes these times as call and execution join points,
        respectively, and allows them to be picked out specifically by
        <tt>call</tt> and <tt>execution</tt> pointcuts.
      </p><p>
        So what's the difference between these join points?  Well, there are a
        number of differences:
      </p><p>
        Firstly, the lexical pointcut declarations
        <tt>within</tt> and <tt>withincode</tt> match
        differently.  At a call join point, the enclosing code is that of
        the call site.  This means that <tt>call(void m())
        &amp;&amp; withincode(void m())</tt> will only capture
        directly recursive calls, for example.  At an execution join point,
        however, the program is already executing the method, so the
        enclosing code is the method itself: <tt>execution(void m())
        &amp;&amp; withincode(void m())</tt> is the same as
        <tt>execution(void m())</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Secondly, the call join point does not capture super calls to
        non-static methods.  This is because such super calls are different in
        Java, since they don't behave via dynamic dispatch like other calls to
        non-static methods.
      </p><p>
        The rule of thumb is that if you want to pick a join point that
        runs when an actual piece of code runs (as is often the case for
        tracing), use <tt>execution</tt>, but if you want to pick
        one that runs when a particular <span class="emphasis"><i>signature</i></span> is
        called (as is often the case for production aspects), use
        <tt>call</tt>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pointcut-composition"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcut-composition"></a>Pointcut composition</h3></div></div><p>
        Pointcuts are put together with the operators and (spelled
        <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>), or (spelled <tt>||</tt>),
        and not (spelled <tt>!</tt>).  This allows the creation
        of very powerful pointcuts from the simple building blocks of
        primitive pointcuts.  This composition can be somewhat confusing
        when used with primitive pointcuts like <tt>cflow</tt>
        and <tt>cflowbelow</tt>.  Here's an example:
      </p><p>
        <tt>cflow(<i><tt>P</tt></i>)</tt> picks out
        each join point in the control flow of the join points picked out
        by <i><tt>P</tt></i>.  So, pictorially:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  P ---------------------
    \
     \  cflow of P
      \
</pre><p>
        What does <tt>cflow(<i><tt>P</tt></i>) &amp;&amp;
        cflow(<i><tt>Q</tt></i>)</tt> pick out?  Well, it
        picks out each join point that is in both the control flow of
        <i><tt>P</tt></i> and in the control flow of
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>.  So...
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
          P ---------------------
            \
             \  cflow of P
              \
               \
                \
  Q -------------\-------
    \             \
     \  cflow of Q \ cflow(P) &amp;&amp; cflow(Q)
      \             \
</pre><p>
        Note that <i><tt>P</tt></i> and
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i> might not have any join points in
        common... but their control flows might have join points in common.
      </p><p>
        But what does <tt>cflow(<i><tt>P</tt></i>
        &amp;&amp; <i><tt>Q</tt></i>)</tt> mean?  Well, it
        means the control flow of those join points that are both picked
        out by <i><tt>P</tt></i> and picked out by
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
   P &amp;&amp; Q -------------------
          \
           \ cflow of (P &amp;&amp; Q)
            \
</pre><p>
        and if there are <span class="emphasis"><i>no</i></span> join points that are both
        picked by <i><tt>P</tt></i> and picked out by
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>, then there's no chance that there are
        any join points in the control flow of
        <tt>(<i><tt>P</tt></i> &amp;&amp;
        <i><tt>Q</tt></i>)</tt>.
      </p><p>
        Here's some code that expresses this.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        foo();
    }
    static void foo() {
        goo();
    }
    static void goo() {
        System.out.println("hi");
    }
}

aspect A  {
    pointcut fooPC(): execution(void Test.foo());
    pointcut gooPC(): execution(void Test.goo());
    pointcut printPC(): call(void java.io.PrintStream.println(String));

    before(): cflow(fooPC()) &amp;&amp; cflow(gooPC()) &amp;&amp; printPC() &amp;&amp; !within(A) {
        System.out.println("should occur");
    }

    before(): cflow(fooPC() &amp;&amp; gooPC()) &amp;&amp; printPC() &amp;&amp; !within(A) {
        System.out.println("should not occur");
    }
}
</pre><p>
          The <tt>!within(<i><tt>A</tt></i>)</tt>
          pointcut above is required to avoid the <tt>printPC</tt> 
          pointcut applying to the <tt>System.out.println</tt>
          call in the advice body. If this was not present a recursive call
          would result as the pointcut would apply to its own advice.
          (See <a href="pitfalls-infiniteLoops.html" title="Infinite loops">the section called &#8220;Infinite loops&#8221;</a> for more details.)
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pointcut-parameters"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcut-parameters"></a>Pointcut Parameters</h3></div></div><p>
        Consider again the first pointcut definition in this chapter:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut setter(): target(Point) &amp;&amp;
                     (call(void setX(int)) ||
                      call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
        As we've seen, this pointcut picks out each call to
        <tt>setX(int)</tt> or <tt>setY(int)</tt>
        methods where the target is an instance of
        <tt>Point</tt>. The pointcut is given the name
        <tt>setters</tt> and no parameters on the left-hand
        side. An empty parameter list means that none of the context from
        the join points is published from this pointcut.  But consider
        another version of version of this pointcut definition:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut setter(Point p): target(p) &amp;&amp;
                            (call(void setX(int)) ||
                             call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
        This version picks out exactly the same join points. But in this
        version, the pointcut has one parameter of type
        <tt>Point</tt>. This means that any advice that uses this
        pointcut has access to a <tt>Point</tt> from each join
        point picked out by the pointcut.  Inside the pointcut definition
        this <tt>Point</tt> is named <tt>p</tt> is
        available, and according to the right-hand side of the definition,
        that <tt>Point p</tt> comes from the
        <tt>target</tt> of each matched join point.
      </p><p>
        Here's another example that illustrates the flexible mechanism for
        defining pointcut parameters:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut testEquality(Point p): target(Point) &amp;&amp;
                                  args(p) &amp;&amp;
                                  call(boolean equals(Object));
</pre><p>
        This pointcut also has a parameter of type
        <tt>Point</tt>.  Similar to the
        <tt>setters</tt> pointcut, this means that anyone using
        this pointcut has access to a <tt>Point</tt> from each
        join point.  But in this case, looking at the right-hand side we
        find that the object named in the parameters is not the target
        <tt>Point</tt> object that receives the call; it's the
        argument (also of type <tt>Point</tt>) passed to the
        <tt>equals</tt> method when some other
        <tt>Point</tt> is the target. If we wanted access to both
        <tt>Point</tt>s, then the pointcut definition that would
        expose target <tt>Point p1</tt> and argument
        <tt>Point p2</tt> would be
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut testEquality(Point p1, Point p2): target(p1) &amp;&amp;
                                             args(p2) &amp;&amp;
                                             call(boolean equals(Object));
</pre><p>
        Let's look at another variation of the <tt>setters</tt> pointcut:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut setter(Point p, int newval): target(p) &amp;&amp;
                                      args(newval) &amp;&amp;
                                      (call(void setX(int)) ||
                                       call(void setY(int)));
</pre><p>
        In this case, a <tt>Point</tt> object and an
        <tt>int</tt> value are exposed by the named
        pointcut. Looking at the the right-hand side of the definition, we
        find that the <tt>Point</tt> object is the target object,
        and the <tt>int</tt> value is the called method's
        argument.
      </p><p>
        The use of pointcut parameters is relatively flexible. The most
        important rule is that all the pointcut parameters must be bound at
        every join point picked out by the pointcut. So, for example, the
        following pointcut definition will result in a compilation error:

<pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut badPointcut(Point p1, Point p2):
      (target(p1) &amp;&amp; call(void setX(int))) ||
      (target(p2) &amp;&amp; call(void setY(int)));
</pre>

        because <tt>p1</tt> is only bound when calling
        <tt>setX</tt>, and <tt>p2</tt> is only bound
        when calling <tt>setY</tt>, but the pointcut picks out
        all of these join points and tries to bind both
        <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt>.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="example"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="example"></a>Example: <tt>HandleLiveness</tt></h3></div></div><p>
        The example below consists of two object classes (plus an exception
        class) and one aspect. Handle objects delegate their public,
        non-static operations to their <tt>Partner</tt>
        objects. The aspect <tt>HandleLiveness</tt> ensures that,
        before the delegations, the partner exists and is alive, or else it
        throws an exception.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  class Handle {
    Partner partner = new Partner();

    public void foo() { partner.foo(); }
    public void bar(int x) { partner.bar(x); }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Handle h1 = new Handle();
      h1.foo();
      h1.bar(2);
    }
  }

  class Partner {
    boolean isAlive() { return true; }
    void foo() { System.out.println("foo"); }
    void bar(int x) { System.out.println("bar " + x); }
  }

  aspect HandleLiveness {
    before(Handle handle): target(handle) &amp;&amp; call(public * *(..)) {
      if ( handle.partner == null  || !handle.partner.isAlive() ) {
        throw new DeadPartnerException();
      }
    }
  }

  class DeadPartnerException extends RuntimeException {}

	  During compilation, AspectJ processes pointcuts in order to try and optimize matching performance.  Examining code and determining
	  if each join point matches (statically or dynamically) a given pointcut is a costly process.
	  (A dynamic match means the match cannot be fully determined from static analysis and a test will be placed in the code
	  to determine if there is an actual match when the code is running).
	  On first encountering a pointcut declaration, AspectJ will rewrite it into an optimal form for the matching process.
	  What does this mean?  Basically pointcuts are rewritten in DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) and the components of the pointcut
	  are sorted such that those components that are cheaper to evaluate are checked first.  This means users do not have to worry
	  about understanding the performance of various pointcut designators and may supply them in any order in their
	  pointcut declarations.
      </p><p>
      However, AspectJ can only work with what it is told, and for optimal performance of matching the user should think
      about what they are trying to achieve and narrow the search space for matches as much as they can in the definition.
      Basically there are three kinds of pointcut designator: kinded, scoping and context:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e1604"></a>
	      Kinded designators are those which select a particular kind of join point. For example: execution, get, set, call, handler
    	</li><li><a name="d0e1606"></a>
         Scoping designators are those which select a group of join points of interest (of probably many kinds). For example: within, withincode
    	</li><li><a name="d0e1608"></a>
         Contextual designators are those that match (and optionally bind) based on context. For example: this, target, @annotation
    	</li></ul></div><p>
      A well written pointcut should 
      try and include at least the first two types (kinded and scoping), whilst the contextual designators may be included if wishing to
      match based on join point context, or bind that context for use in the advice.  Supplying either just a kinded designator or 
      just a contextual designator will work but could affect weaving performance (time and memory used) 
      due to all the extra processing and analysis. 
      Scoping designators are very fast to match, they can very quickly dismiss groups of join points that should not be further 
      processed - that is why a good pointcut should always include one if possible.
