      and where <i><tt>Formal</tt></i> refers to a
        variable binding like those used for method parameters,
        of the form 
        <tt><i><tt>Type</tt></i></tt>
        <tt><i><tt>Variable-Name</tt></i></tt>,

        list of <i><tt>Formal</tt></i>.
    </p><p>
      Advice defines crosscutting behavior.  It is defined in terms of
      pointcuts. The code of a piece of advice runs at every join point
      picked out by its pointcut. Exactly how the code runs depends on the
      kind of advice.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ supports three kinds of advice. The kind of advice determines how
      it interacts with the join points it is defined over. Thus AspectJ
      divides advice into that which runs before its join points, that which
      runs after its join points, and that which runs in place of (or "around")
      its join points.
    </p><p>
      While before advice is relatively unproblematic, there can be three
      interpretations of after advice: After the execution of a join point
      completes normally, after it throws an exception, or after it does either
      one. AspectJ allows after advice for any of these situations.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      pointcut publicCall(): call(public Object *(..));
      after() returning (Object o): publicCall() {
	  System.out.println("Returned normally with " + o);
      }
      after() throwing (Exception e): publicCall() {
	  System.out.println("Threw an exception: " + e);
      }
      after(): publicCall(){
	  System.out.println("Returned or threw an Exception");
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      After returning advice may not care about its returned object, in which
      case it may be written
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  after() returning: call(public Object *(..)) {
      System.out.println("Returned normally");
  }
</pre><p>
      If after returning does expose its returned object, then the
      type of the parameter is considered to be an
      <tt>instanceof</tt>-like constraint on the advice:  it
      will run only when the return value is of the appropriate type.
    </p><p>
      A value is of the appropriate type if it would be assignable to
      a variable of that type, in the Java sense.  That is, a
      <tt>byte</tt> value is assignable to a
      <tt>short</tt> parameter but not vice-versa, an
      <tt>int</tt> is assignable to a
      <tt>float</tt> parameter, <tt>boolean</tt>
      values are only assignable to <tt>boolean</tt>
      parameters, and reference types work by instanceof.
    </p><p>
      There are two special cases: If the exposed value is typed to
      <tt>Object</tt>, then the advice is not constrained by
      that type: the actual return value is converted to an object
      type for the body of the advice: <tt>int</tt> values
      are represented as <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt> objects,
      etc, and no value (from void methods, for example) is
      represented as <tt>null</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Secondly, the <tt>null</tt> value is assignable to a
      parameter <tt>T</tt> if the join point
      <span class="emphasis"><i>could</i></span> return something of type
      <tt>T</tt>.
    </p><p>
      Around advice runs in place of the join point it operates over, rather
      than before or after it.  Because around is allowed to return a value, it
      must be declared with a return type, like a method.
    </p><p>
      Thus, a simple use of around advice is to make a particular method
      constant:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      int around(): call(int C.foo()) {
	  return 3;
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      Within the body of around advice, though, the computation of the original
      join point can be executed with the special syntax
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  proceed( ... )
</pre><p>
      The proceed form takes as arguments the context exposed by the around's
      pointcut, and returns whatever the around is declared to return. So the
      following around advice will double the second argument to
      <tt>foo</tt> whenever it is called, and then halve its result:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      int around(int i): call(int C.foo(Object, int)) &amp;&amp; args(i) {
	  int newi = proceed(i*2)
	  return newi/2;
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      If the return value of around advice is typed to
      <tt>Object</tt>, then the result of proceed is converted to an
      object representation, even if it is originally a primitive value.  And
      when the advice returns an Object value, that value is converted back to
      whatever representation it was originally.  So another way to write the
      doubling and halving advice is:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      Object around(int i): call(int C.foo(Object, int)) &amp;&amp; args(i) {
	  Integer newi = (Integer) proceed(i*2)
	  return new Integer(newi.intValue() / 2);
      }
  }
</pre><p>
		Any occurence of <tt>proceed(..)</tt> within the body of around 
        advice is treated as the special proceed form (even if the
		aspect defines a method named <tt>proceed</tt>), unless a 
		target other than the aspect instance is specified as the recipient of
		the call.
		For example, in the following program the first 
		call to proceed will be treated as a method call to
		the <tt>ICanProceed</tt> instance, whereas the second call to
		proceed is treated as the special proceed form.
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
     Object around(ICanProceed canProceed) : execution(* *(..)) &amp;&amp; this(canProceed) {
        canProceed.proceed();         // a method call
        return proceed(canProceed);   // the special proceed form
     }
     
     private Object proceed(ICanProceed canProceed) {
        // this method cannot be called from inside the body of around advice in
        // the aspect
     }
  }	
</pre><p>
      In all kinds of advice, the parameters of the advice behave exactly like
      method parameters.  In particular, assigning to any parameter affects
      only the value of the parameter, not the value that it came from.  This
      means that
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
      after() returning (int i): call(int C.foo()) {
	  i = i * 2;
      }
  }
</pre><p>
      will <span class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> double the returned value of the advice.
      Rather, it will double the local parameter.  Changing the values of
      parameters or return values of join points can be done by using around
      advice.
    </p><p>
        With <tt>proceed(..)</tt> it is possible to change the values
        used by less-precedent advice and the underlying join point by supplying
        different values for the variables.  For example, this aspect replaces
        the string bound to <tt>s</tt> in the named pointcut 
        <tt>privateData</tt>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  aspect A {
    Object around(String s): MyPointcuts.privateData(s) {
      return proceed("private data");
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        If you replace an argument to <tt>proceed(..)</tt>, you can cause 
        a <tt>ClassCastException</tt> at runtime when the argument
        refers to a supertype of the actual type and you do not supply a 
        reference of the actual type.  In the following aspect, the
        around advice replaces the declared target <tt>List</tt> 
        with an <tt>ArrayList</tt>.  This is valid code at
        compile-time since the types match.  
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  import java.util.*;

  aspect A {
    Object around(List list): call(* List+.*()) &amp;&amp; target(list) {
      return proceed(new ArrayList());
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        But imagine a simple program where the actual target is
        <tt>LinkedList</tt>.  In this case, the advice would cause a
        <tt>ClassCastException</tt> at runtime, and 
        <tt>peek()</tt> is not declared in <tt>ArrayList</tt>.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      new LinkedList().peek();
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        The <tt>ClassCastException</tt> can occur even in situations
        where it appears to be unnecessary, e.g., if the program is changed to
        call <tt>size()</tt>, declared in <tt>List</tt>:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
  public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      new LinkedList().size();
    }
  }
</pre><p>
        There will still be a <tt>ClassCastException</tt> because
        it is impossible to prove that there won't be a runtime binary-compatible
        change in the hierarchy of <tt>LinkedList</tt> or some
        other advice on the join point that requires a 
        <tt>LinkedList</tt>.
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="advice-modifiers"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="advice-modifiers"></a>Advice modifiers</h3></div></div><p>
        The <tt>strictfp</tt> modifier is the only modifier allowed
        on advice, and it has the effect of making all floating-point
        expressions within the advice be FP-strict.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="advice-and-checked-exceptions"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="advice-and-checked-exceptions"></a>Advice and checked exceptions</h3></div></div><p>
        An advice declaration must include a <tt>throws</tt> clause
        listing the checked exceptions the body may throw.  This list of
        checked exceptions must be compatible with each target join point
        of the advice, or an error is signalled by the compiler.
      </p><p>
        For example, in the following declarations:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

  class C {
      int i;

      int getI() { return i; }
  }

  aspect A {
      before(): get(int C.i) {
	  throw new FileNotFoundException();
      }
      before() throws FileNotFoundException: get(int C.i) {
	  throw new FileNotFoundException();
      }
  }
</pre><p>
        both pieces of advice are illegal.  The first because the body throws
        an undeclared checked exception, and the second because field get join
        points cannot throw <tt>FileNotFoundException</tt>s.
      </p><p> The exceptions that each kind of join point in AspectJ may throw are:
      </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><a name="d0e6294"></a><span class="term">method call and execution</span></dt><dd>
          the checked exceptions declared by the target method's

        Multiple pieces of advice may apply to the same join point.  In such
        cases, the resolution order of the advice is based on advice
        precedence.
      </p><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e6343"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e6343"></a>Determining precedence</h4></div></div><p>There are a number of rules that determine whether a particular
        piece of advice has precedence over another when they advise the same
        join point. </p><p>If the two pieces of advice are defined in different aspects,
        then there are three cases: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e6351"></a>If aspect A is matched earlier than aspect B in some
          <tt>declare precedence</tt> form, then all advice in
          concrete aspect A has precedence over all advice in concrete aspect B
          when they are on the same join point.  </li><li><a name="d0e6356"></a>
          Otherwise, if aspect A is a subaspect of aspect B, then all advice
          defined in A has precedence over all advice defined in
          B. So, unless otherwise specified with
          <tt>declare precedence</tt>, advice in a subaspect
          has precedence over advice in a superaspect.
          </li><li><a name="d0e6361"></a>
          Otherwise, if two pieces of advice are defined in two different
          aspects, it is undefined which one has precedence.
          </li></ul></div><p>If the two pieces of advice are defined in the same aspect, then
        there are two cases: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><a name="d0e6366"></a>If either are <tt>after</tt> advice, then the one that
          appears later in the aspect has precedence over the one that appears

      after():  execution(void main(String[] args)) {}
      before(): execution(void main(String[] args)) {}

</pre><p>such circularities will result in errors signalled by the compiler. </p></div><div class="sect3"><a name="d0e6379"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e6379"></a>Effects of precedence</h4></div></div><p>At a particular join point, advice is ordered by precedence.</p><p>A piece of <tt>around</tt> advice controls whether

        </p><p>Running <tt>after returning</tt> advice will run the

        Three special variables are visible within bodies of advice
          and within <tt>if()</tt> pointcut expressions: 
        <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt>,
        <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt>, and
        <tt>thisEnclosingJoinPointStaticPart</tt>. Each is bound to
        an object that encapsulates some of the context of the advice's current
        or enclosing join point.  These variables exist because some pointcuts
        may pick out very large collections of join points. For example, the
        pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  pointcut publicCall(): call(public * *(..));
</pre><p>
        picks out calls to many methods. Yet the body of advice over this
        pointcut may wish to have access to the method name or parameters of a
        particular join point.
      </p><p>
        <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> is bound to a complete join point
        object.

      </p><p>
        <tt>thisJoinPointStaticPart</tt> is bound to a part of the
        join point object that includes less information, but for which no
        memory allocation is required on each execution of the advice.  It is
        equivalent to <tt>thisJoinPoint.getStaticPart()</tt>.
      </p><p>
        <tt>thisEnclosingJoinPointStaticPart</tt> is bound to the
        static part of the join point enclosing the current join point.  Only
        the static part of this enclosing join point is available through this
        mechanism.
      </p><p>
        Standard Java reflection uses objects from the
        <tt>java.lang.reflect</tt> hierarchy to build up its
        reflective objects.  Similarly, AspectJ join point objects have types
        in a type hierarchy.  The type of objects bound to
        <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> is
        <tt>org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint</tt>, while
        <tt>thisStaticJoinPoint</tt> is bound to objects of interface
        type <tt>org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint.StaticPart</tt>.
