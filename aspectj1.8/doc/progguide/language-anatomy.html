      This lesson explains the parts of AspectJ's aspects. By reading this
      lesson you will have an overview of what's in an aspect and you will
      be exposed to the new terminology introduced by AspectJ.

        Here's an example of an aspect definition in AspectJ:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
 1 aspect FaultHandler {
 2
 3   private boolean Server.disabled = false;
 4
 5   private void reportFault() {
 6     System.out.println("Failure! Please fix it.");
 7   }
 8
 9   public static void fixServer(Server s) {
10     s.disabled = false;
11   }
12
13   pointcut services(Server s): target(s) &amp;&amp; call(public * *(..));
14
15   before(Server s): services(s) {
16     if (s.disabled) throw new DisabledException();
17   }
18
19   after(Server s) throwing (FaultException e): services(s) {
20     s.disabled = true;
21     reportFault();
22   }
23 }
</pre><p>
        The <tt>FaultHandler</tt> consists of one inter-type
        field on <tt>Server</tt> (line 03), two methods (lines
        05-07 and 09-11), one pointcut definition (line 13), and two pieces
        of advice (lines 15-17 and 19-22).
      </p><p>
        This covers the basics of what aspects can contain. In general,
        aspects consist of an association of other program entities,
        ordinary variables and methods, pointcut definitions, inter-type declarations,
        and advice, where advice may be before, after or around advice. The
        remainder of this lesson focuses on those crosscut-related
        constructs.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pointcuts"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcuts"></a>Pointcuts</h3></div></div><p>
        AspectJ's pointcut definitions give names to pointcuts.  Pointcuts
        themselves pick out join points, i.e. interesting points in the
        execution of a program. These join points can be method or
        constructor invocations and executions, the handling of exceptions,
        field assignments and accesses, etc. Take, for example, the
        pointcut definition in line 13:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut services(Server s): target(s) &amp;&amp; call(public * *(..))
</pre><p>
        This pointcut, named <tt>services</tt>, picks out those
        points in the execution of the program when
        <tt>Server</tt> objects have their public methods called.
        It also allows anyone using the <tt>services</tt>
        pointcut to access the <tt>Server</tt> object whose
        method is being called.
      </p><p>
        The idea behind this pointcut in the
        <tt>FaultHandler</tt> aspect is that
        fault-handling-related behavior must be triggered on the calls to
        public methods. For example, the server may be unable to proceed
        with the request because of some fault. The calls of those methods
        are, therefore, interesting events for this aspect, in the sense
        that certain fault-related things will happen when these events
        occur.
      </p><p>
        Part of the context in which the events occur is exposed by the
        formal parameters of the pointcut. In this case, that consists of
        objects of type <tt>Server</tt>.  That formal parameter
        is then being used on the right hand side of the declaration in
        order to identify which events the pointcut refers to. In this
        case, a pointcut picking out join points where a Server is the
        target of some operation (target(s)) is being composed
        (<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, meaning and) with a pointcut
        picking out call join points (call(...)). The calls are identified
        by signatures that can include wild cards. In this case, there are
        wild cards in the return type position (first *), in the name
        position (second *) and in the argument list position (..); the
        only concrete information is given by the qualifier
        <tt>public</tt>.
      </p><p>
         Pointcuts pick out arbitrarily large numbers of join points of a
         program. But they pick out only a small number of
         <span class="emphasis"><i>kinds</i></span> of join points. Those kinds of join
         points correspond to some of the most important concepts in
         Java. Here is an incomplete list: method call, method execution,
         exception handling, instantiation, constructor execution, and
         field access.  Each kind of join point can be picked out by its
         own specialized pointcut that you will learn about in other parts
         of this guide.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="advice"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="advice"></a>Advice</h3></div></div><p>
        A piece of advice brings together a pointcut and a body of code to
        define aspect implementation that runs at join points picked out by
        the pointcut. For example, the advice in lines 15-17 specifies that
        the following piece of code
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
{
  if (s.disabled) throw new DisabledException();
}
</pre><p>
        is executed when instances of the <tt>Server</tt> class
        have their public methods called, as specified by the pointcut
        <tt>services</tt>. More specifically, it runs when those
        calls are made, just before the corresponding methods are executed.
      </p><p>
        The advice in lines 19-22 defines another piece of implementation
        that is executed on the same pointcut:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
{
  s.disabled = true;
  reportFault();
}
</pre><p>
        But this second method executes after those operations throw
        exception of type <tt>FaultException</tt>.
      </p><p>
        There are two other variations of after advice: upon successful
        return and upon return, either successful or with an exception.
        There is also a third kind of advice called around. You will see
        those in other parts of this guide.
