    The initial implementations of AspectJ have all been
    compiler-based implementations.  Certain elements of AspectJ's
    semantics are difficult to implement without making modifications
    to the virtual machine, which a compiler-based implementation
    cannot do.  One way to deal with this problem would be to specify
    only the behavior that is easiest to implement.  We have chosen a
    somewhat different approach, which is to specify an ideal language
    semantics, as well as a clearly defined way in which
    implementations are allowed to deviate from that semantics.  This
    makes it possible to develop conforming AspectJ implementations
    today, while still making it clear what later, and presumably
    better, implementations should do tomorrow.
  </p><p>
    According to the AspectJ language semantics, the declaration
  </p><pre class="programlisting">
  before(): get(int Point.x) { System.out.println("got x"); }
</pre><p>
    should advise all accesses of a field of type int and name x from
    instances of type (or subtype of) Point.  It should do this
    regardless of whether all the source code performing the access
    was available at the time the aspect containing this advice was
    compiled, whether changes were made later, etc.
  </p><p>   
    But AspectJ implementations are permitted to deviate from this in
    a well-defined way -- they are permitted to advise only accesses
    in <span class="emphasis"><i>code the implementation controls</i></span>.  Each
    implementation is free within certain bounds to provide its own
    definition of what it means to control code.
  </p><p>
    In the current AspectJ compiler, ajc, control of the code means
    having bytecode for any aspects and all the code they should
    affect available during the compile. This means that if some class
    Client contains code with the expression <tt>new
    Point().x</tt> (which results in a field get join point at
    runtime), the current AspectJ compiler will fail to advise that
    access unless Client.java or Client.class is compiled as well. It
    also means that join points associated with code in native methods
    (including their execution join points) cannot be advised.
  </p><p>
    Different join points have different requirements.  Method and
    constructor call join points can be advised only if ajc controls
    the bytecode for the caller.  Field reference or assignment join
    points can be advised only if ajc controls the bytecode for the
    "caller", the code actually making the reference or assignment.
    Initialization join points can be advised only if ajc controls the
    bytecode of the type being initialized, and execution join points
    can be advised only if ajc controls the bytecode for the method or
    constructor body in question.
  	The end of an exception handler is underdetermined in bytecode,
  	so ajc will not implement after or around advice on handler join 
  	points.
  	Similarly, ajc cannot implement around advice on initialization 
  	or preinitialization join points.  
    In cases where ajc cannot implement advice, it will emit a 
    compile-time error noting this as a compiler limitation.
  </p><p>
    Aspects that are defined <tt>perthis</tt> or
    <tt>pertarget</tt> also have restrictions based on
    control of the code.  In particular, at a join point where the
    bytecode for the currently executing object is not available, an
    aspect defined <tt>perthis</tt> of that join point will
    not be associated.  So aspects defined
    <tt>perthis(Object)</tt> will not create aspect
    instances for every object unless <tt>Object</tt>is part
    of the compile.  Similar restrictions apply to
    <tt>pertarget</tt> aspects.
  </p><p>
    Inter-type declarations such as <tt>declare parents</tt>
    also have restrictions based on control of the code.  If the
    bytecode for the target of an inter-type declaration is not
    available, then the inter-type declaration is not made on that
    target.  So, <tt>declare parents : String implements
    MyInterface</tt> will not work for
    <tt>java.lang.String</tt> unless
    <tt>java.lang.String</tt> is part of the compile.
  </p><p>
  	When declaring members on interfaces, the implementation must
  	control both the interface and the top-level implementors of 
  	that interface (the classes that implement the interface but
  	do not have a superclass that implements the interface).
  	You may weave these separately, but be aware that you will get
  	runtime exceptions if you run the affected top-level classes
  	without the interface as produced by the same ajc implementation.  	
  	Any intertype declaration of an abstract method on an interface 
  	must be specified as public, you will get a compile time error 
  	message indicating this is a compiler limitation if you do not 
  	specify public.  A non-abstract method declared on an interface
  	can use any access modifier except protected.  Note that this is
  	different to normal Java rules where all members declared in 
  	an interface are implicitly public.
  	Finally, note that one cannot define static fields or methods 
  	on interfaces.
  </p><p>
	When declaring methods on target types, only methods declared 
	public are recognizable in the bytecode, so methods must be 
	declared public to be overridden in any subtype or to be called 
	from code in a later compile using the target type as a library.
  </p><p>
    Other AspectJ implementations, indeed, future versions of ajc, may
    define <span class="emphasis"><i>code the implementation controls</i></span> more
    liberally or restrictively, so long as they comport with the Java
	language.  For example, the <tt>call</tt> pointcut does
	not pick out reflective calls to a method implemented in 
	<tt>java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Object, Object[])</tt>.
	Some suggest that the call "happens" and the call pointcut should
	pick it out, but the AspectJ language shouldn't anticipate what happens
	in code outside the control of the implementation, even when it
	is a a well-defined API in a Java standard library.
  </p><p>
    The important thing to remember is that core concepts of AspectJ,
    such as the join point, are unchanged, regardless of which
    implementation is used. During your development, you will have to
    be aware of the limitations of the ajc compiler you're using, but
    these limitations should not drive the design of your aspects.
